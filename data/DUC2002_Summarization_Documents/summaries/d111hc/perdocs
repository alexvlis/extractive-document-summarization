Greek divers located the remains of a wooden sailing vessel on 3 May 1988. The vessel 
was found near Chios, a Greek island in the eastern Aegean Sea, where a Greek naval 
vessel sank a Turkish warship on 7 June 1882.

The Turkish vessel was identified as the Bourloti Seimaz, or translated as "Explosives 
Invincible". It was returning from raiding and killing thousands of Greeks on Chios. 
More than 1,000, including 400 Greeks, were aboard the Turkish ship. The ship was 
crammed with loot taken from Chios. The Greek divers hope to interest American and Turkish
experts to help in recovering the vessel.</SUM>

A freighter with a cargo of beer sank today 28 nautical miles north of the Ameland, a 
Dutch island in the North Sea. This is an area of heavy freight traffic. The ship sank 
about 12:45 P.M. in high winds. A West German helicopter from the island of Borkum, 
30 miles from where the ship went down, took the crewmen ashore.

The Coast Guard identified the ship as a Finnish-registered freighter, but did not identify 
it by name. The ship's origin and destination were not provided. Earlier reports had 
identified the ship as a passenger ferry.</SUM>

Leopold Gratz, President of the Austrian Parliament, resigned today because of the 
scandal surrounding the mysterious sinking if the Lucona 12 years ago. Another Austrian 
politician, who like Gratz, was involved in the scandal, resigned last month. Udo Proksch 
is the prime suspect in the sinking of the Lucona in the Indian Ocean 12 years ago. Six 
sailors died.

Proksch claimed the Lucona carried a valuable cargo. It was insured for 16 million 
dollars. The insurance company refused to pay, saying that the Lucona carried scrap 
metal and was sunk intentionally. Proksch is a fugitive. Gratz is accused of helping 
Proksch.</SUM>

The 400-foot Argentine supply ship, the Bahia Paraiso, sank Tuesday after running 
aground. The ship was 600 miles south of Cape Horn, and about two miles from a United 
States research facility on the Antarctic Peninsula. The 316 people aboard the ship, 
including 82 tourists, were rescued by power boats after the ship ran aground.

The ship was carrying jet fuel, gasoline, canisters of compressed gases, and other supplies 
to the Argentine Esperanza Station near the tip of the Antarctica Peninsula. There is great 
concern that diesel fuel would leak and damage the unspoiled ecology of Antarctica.</SUM>

Twenty-three sailors from the Star of Alexandria, a 652 foot freighter, were rescued 
Monday evening 400 miles southeast of Cape Cod. Two other crew members were 
missing. The ship could not be spotted, and apparently had gone down in rough seas. The 
sailors in a lifeboat used a radio dropped by a Coast Guard aircraft to contact the 
merchant ship Ravenscraig that rescued them.

The Star of Alexandria was built in 1966, and was registered in England. It was designed 
to carry bulk freight, and was carrying cement from Athens to New York when it went 
down.</SUM>

The Ostwind, an 85-foot yacht built for Hitler, was sunk on 4 June 1989. The sinking was 
arranged to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the United States' action in refusing to 
allow the landing of the SS St. Louis with its 900 Jewish passengers seeking refuge. The 
organizers botched up the operation. The yacht was sunk a mile from the intended site. It 
settled on a living reed in a shallow shipping lane. The government ordered it cut up or 
moved.

Hitler very seldom used the Ostwind. The badly decayed yacht ended up in a Jacksonville 
marina.</SUM>

Robert Ballard, an American oceanographer, earlier this month used an ocean-crawling 
robot to locate the German battleship Bismarck. The battleship is resting under 15,000 
feet of water about 600 miles west of Brest, France. It went down on 27 May 1941. Only 
110 of the 2,200-man crew were survived the sinking of Germany's most powerful 
battleship.

Structural evidence convinced Ballard the Germans scuttled the battleship. Only scuttled 
ships tend to remain in one piece. Under the laws of the sea the battleship is still German 
property. Ballard said that he would reveal the exact location only to Germany.</SUM>

A United States Coast Guard ship on patrol spotted a man and woman in a raft about 30 
miles off the coast of Costa Rica. Several whales had attacked and sunk their pleasure 
boat Sibonay about 1,200 miles southwest of Costa Rica. They survived 66 days in their 
rubber life raft by eating raw fish and drinking purified water.

A Coast Guard officer wasn't sure if there were any documented cases of whale 
aggression. The couple, William and Simone Butler, are resting in a Costa Rican hospital. 
William Butler is an experienced sailor. They were sailing from Coral Gables to 
Honolulu.</SUM>

The Korean-flagged fishing vessel Chin Yuan Hsing was scuttled in waters off Argentina 
on 21 May 1994. Adverse weather conditions prevailed when the Argentine corvette 
Spiro spotted the Korean ship fishing illegally in restricted Argentine waters. The Korean 
vessel did not respond to the corvette's warning. Instead, the Korean crew sank their ship, 
and transferred to another Korean ship sailing nearby.

In accordance with a UK-Argentine agreement, the Argentine Navy turned the 
surveillance of the second Korean vessel over to the British when it approached within 15 
nautical miles of the Malvinas (Falkland) Islands.</SUM>

The recent tragic sinking of the ferry Estonia, with the loss of 800-plus lives, has 
concentrated attention on making ferries safer. Over the past two decades the United 
Nations Maritime Organization has devoted much thought to ship safety, but now in 
September 1994 it is an imperative. Any review of ferry safety will focus on ferry design, 
enforcement of existing regulations, and crew training.

Little attention is paid when a vessel with a third-world crew goes down in a distant 
ocean, but the loss of a relatively modern passenger ferry in European waters concerns 
the public.</SUM>
