Ships sink for many reasons.  Many because of severe weather conditions at
sea, some because they run aground, some because of design faults, some by
hostile action, and some smaller vessels sink after encounters with marine
animals. Sometimes a ship sinking is deliberate.  Dishonest owners have sunk
their ships in order to collect insurance money.  Crews have deliberately
sunk their ship to prevent it from falling into enemy hands during wartime
or at other times to conceal evidence of illegal activity.  Older or
derelict ships often serve to help establish a coral reef or become a
memorial when sunk.  Many ships sink each year.  In 1993, 96 general cargo
ships, 12 tankers, and 5 ferries went to the bottom.

Loss of life, sometimes heavy, usually occurs when a ship sinks.  A ferry
sinking in 1994 caused more than 800 deaths.  Sea explorers search for
sunken vessels to determine exactly where and often why they sank.  Some
hope to recover treasures.

Historic events have resulted from ships sinking.  In the 18th century, a
ship sinking figured in the Greek struggle for independence from the Ottoman
Empire.  In the 20th century, two high Austrian government officials
resigned because of a scandal, which involved the sinking of a ship.</SUM>
