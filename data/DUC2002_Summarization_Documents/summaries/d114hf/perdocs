Fighting between police and Moslem separatists in Srinagar, the summer
capital of the Jammu-Kashmir state killed at least 21 and wounded 100.
Police had imposed a 24-hour curfew to quell the violence resulting from the
militants, led by the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, holding anti-India
demonstrations.  However, crowds defied the curfew. Heavy rains caused
fighting to taper off but the situation remains tense and dangerous.  Both
India and Pakistan claim parts of Kashmir in a dispute that started after
the state was partitioned in 1947.  Most of the population of Kashmir is
Moslem while Jammu is predominately Hindu.</SUM>

An intelligence officer in Srinagar in Kashmir told his men to shoot any of
the die-hard terrorists they spot as their jeep patrols the streets of this
city of one million people.  The governor of Jammu-Kashmir said that "a
handful of terrorists" are creating a law and order problem, which led to a
government crackdown.  The separatists groups are not united, which gives
the government an advantage.  At least 72 people have been killed in the
past week.  At the end of British colonial rule in 1947, Kashmir opted to
join India.  Pakistan took the western part of Kashmir and India the
eastern.</SUM>

Moslem militants armed with AK-47 rifles killed two unarmed paramilitary
soldiers on Thursday.  This brings to 81 the number killed since January
20th in clashes between security forces and Moslem militants fighting for
independence from India.  Police officials said that militants had also
exploded bombs in a government building and a bank and had set a fire in a
shopping center.  Kashmir militants had earlier campaigned to join Pakistan
because of its predominately Moslem population but now they wish
independence and status as a neutral country.  Sixty-four percent of the
population of Jammu-Kashmir, India's only predominantly Moslem state are
Moslems.</SUM>

Indian border guards fired on hundreds of Pakistanis who tried to cross a
cease-fire line separating the Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir from that
held by India.  Pakistani troops then fired on the Indian security forces.
No one was hurt in the exchange.  A fluid 840-mile cease-fire line separates
the Indian and Pakistan parts of Kashmir.  The conflict over Kashmir flared
January 20th after a government crackdown and arrest of 250 suspected
militants.  They were soon released; however, the arrests sparked the
violence. The majority of the 85 people killed in the violence have been
protesters shot by security forces.</SUM>

A Pakistani soldier became the first military casualty during the recent
unease on the Kashmir border when he was shot in the leg at the cease-fire
line.  Relations were strained between India and Pakistan after Indian
troops launched a crackdown on Moslem separatists in Jammu-Kashmir.  Leaders
of both countries have tried to calm things and not allow the situation to
erupt into war.  The situation does remain tense and shooting incidents
continue to occur.  Another sign of increased tensions: Pakistani and Indian

The latest round of secessionist violence and government crackdown has
resulted in 109 persons killed.  The president of the Pakistan state of
Kashmir said that Kashmiris have begun smuggling arms to Moslem insurgents
fighting for independence from India.  Thousands of Moslems went to a Moslem
saint's shrine to seek blessings to liberate Kashmir from India. In
Srinagar, Moslem militants told people to change their watches to correspond
to Pakistan time.  Fights broke out when people refused to comply.  At least
200,000 people marched to the United Nations Military Observers Group

In the most recent violence in Kashmir, Moslems blew up a truck killing
three soldiers.  In other incidents, militants killed a Moslem said to be a
police informer and another died when caught in exchange of gunfire between

to at least 195.  Four of the most recently killed were Moslems, two of
which were likely Communists, and the fifth was not identified.  A former

him after he tried to hurl a grenade into a police bunker while riding by on

Soldiers and police prevented the procession and took Wani's body to a

Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto accused India of genocide in
Kashmir.  She was referring to the assassination of the top Moslem cleric in
Indian Kashmir.  During his funeral Indian forces shot to death 58 people.
Ms Bhutto returned from a visit to Arab and Moslem countries claiming their

This action follows the killing of at least 29 Moslem militants by Indian
security forces.  Meanwhile, in the Pakistani capital Islamabad, Pakistan
and India began negotiations to repair deteriorating conditions between the
