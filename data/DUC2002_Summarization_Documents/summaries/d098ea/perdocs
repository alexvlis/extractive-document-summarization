The countdown began Saturday for launching of Space Shuttle Discovery on its mission 
of hoisting the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) into orbit above the earth's atmosphere. 
Launch is scheduled for 8:31 a.m. EDT Tuesday. The $1.5 billion telescope is expected 
to start providing significant scientific data in a month or two. HST is considered to be 
the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo first used a telescope in 1609. It may 
help test the theory arising from the work of Edwin P. Hubble, for whom it is named, 
that the ever expanding universe was created by a tremendous explosion some 15 
billion years ago.</SUM>

After years of delay and a last-minute snag, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was 
freed from the shuttle Discovery at 3:38 p.m. EDT on Wednesday and placed in orbit 
380 miles above the earth, 70 miles higher than any shuttle has previously flown. The 
telescope's 10-foot aperture door is to be opened Friday exposing the finely polished 
94.5-inch mirror to starlight. NASA expects its first image from the telescope on 
Tuesday. The HST is named for the late American astronomer Edwin P. Hubble who 
discovered during the 1920s that the universe was expanding, giving rise to the Big 
Bang theory of creation.</SUM>

The long delayed launching of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has evoked a burst 
of superlatives from the nation's scientists. From James Westphal at the California 
Institute of Technology we hear, "No one ever made anything that good." Edward 
Weiler, the chief NASA scientist on the HST project declares, "On a clear, dark night 
you can see a flashlight from two miles away. With a 28-power telescope you can see it 
on the moon 250,000 miles away. With the HST you could see a firefly in Australia from 
Washington." Others hail HST as the greatest thing since Galileo's telescope in 1609.</SUM>

The Discovery crew deployed the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) on Wednesday but 
stayed nearby in case there was trouble opening the aperture door. The door was 
opened Friday morning, exposing the telescope's finely polished 95.5-inch eye to 
starlight for the first time. When the door opened, however, two of HST's four position-
stabilizing gyroscopes stopped working. Engineers got the gyroscopes back on line, but 
there were still problems with linking the high-speed dish antennas with a relay satellite 
so the planned release on Tuesday of HST's first test image has been delayed. 
Scientific data will follow in a month or two.</SUM>

The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) orbited with its lens cover open Friday, but its 
electronics were shut down due to a malfunction. HST's 10-foot aluminum aperture 
door was opened exposing its finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight for the first 
time, but problems with its high-speed antennas will delay the release of its first test 
image which had been planned for Tuesday. Scientific data will follow in a moth or two. 
From its orbit high above the earth's distorting atmosphere HST will enable 
astronomers over its 15-year lifetime to look back 14 billion years and possibly 
determine the age of the universe.</SUM>

The door covering the lens of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) opened today and 
Mission Control told the Discovery astronauts they are no longer needed. When the 
door was opened, however, it jarred the telescope causing two of its four gyroscopes to 
stop working and the electronic system to shut down. By early afternoon a  procedure 
was started to bring the electronics back on line. On Tuesday NASA plans to release its 
first test image. The 12-ton, 43-foot-long telescope is named for the late astronomer 
Edwin P. Hubble who discovered in the 1920s that the universe is expanding.</SUM>

NASA ground controllers finally made contact today with the two main antennas on the 
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) after trying for more than six hours to lock on. The HST 
will be tested today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture door is opened Friday 
exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight. Then on Tuesday NASA 
expects to release the first image from the telescope. Astronomers hope to use the 
HST to determine how and when the universe was formed. The telescope was originally 
scheduled for launch in 1983 but was delayed by technical problems and the 
Challenger accident.</SUM>

Discovery's astronauts sent the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) floating free from the 
shuttle today and it began orbiting Earth every 97.3 minutes at an altitude of 380 miles. 
Ground controllers had difficulty unfurling two 39-foot solar panels which provide the 
power to recharge the telescope's batteries but succeeded on a third try. Earlier this 
morning the Discovery commander maneuvered the shuttle into its deployment position 
to put the HST's solar arrays in the proper position to quickly start collecting energy. 
The HST is 43 feet long, weighs 24,250 pounds and is about the size of a railroad tank 
car.</SUM>

The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has arrived  seven years late where it belongs: 
aboard the shuttle Discovery orbiting 380 miles above Earth. It was supposed to be 
launched in 1983, but technical problems and the Challenger accident delayed its 
deployment. The telescope has two mirrors, two cameras, two spectrometers, a 
photometer, and a fine pointing system providing precise measurement of distances. 
On Wednesday a Discovery astronaut will operate the shuttle's mechanical arm to lift 
the 12-ton HST out of the cargo bay and drop it overboard to orbit on its own. Scientists 
have hailed the HST as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo.</SUM>

Six hours after a failed attempt, ground controllers re-established contact Thursday with 
the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) through its main antennas. Controllers sent 
positional information to the telescope and widened the radio beam to cover a larger 
area around the two high-speed  antennas. Space shuttle Discovery trailed 57 miles 
behind the HST and was to stay nearby until the Hubble's aperture door is opened 
Friday morning. If signals fail to open the  door, astronauts will walk into space and 
crank it open Saturday. The shuttle, scheduled to return to earth on Sunday, would 
extend its mission if the space walk is necessary.</SUM>

Astronomers were jubilant as the space shuttle Discovery lifted off carrying the Hubble 
Space Telescope into orbit, putting an end to seven years of delays caused by 
technical problems and the Challenger explosion. Charles O'Dell who has worked 19 
years on Hubble declared, "There is nothing better than to see 19 years of my work and 
five of my friends thrust into orbit." Physics and astronomy professor Colin Norman 
called the launch "the perfect start to a great adventure for mankind." William Jeffreys, 
Hubble's astrometry project leader proclaimed, "This is one of those times when we are 
thrilled beyond belief."</SUM>

Five astronauts boarded Discovery today preparing to send the Hubble Space 
Telescope (HST) into orbit at an altitude of 380 miles. The day after launch one of the 
astronauts will use the shuttle's mechanical arm to  lift the 24,250 pound telescope into 
space. Then Discovery will follow the HST at a distance of 40 miles until its lens cap is 
opened. The HST will not  provide scientific data for a month or so after liftoff, but 
NASA plans to release its first image next week. HST will provide astronomers with 10 
times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.</SUM>
