Beginning of Time</s>
<s docid="AP900424-0048" num="22" wdcount="20"> Hubble has been waiting to take its 
place in space since 1983, delayed by technical problems and the Challenger 
accident.</s>
<s docid="AP900424-0096" num="44" wdcount="17"> The problem was overcome and the 
shuttle lifted off at 8:34 a.m. EDT, about three minutes late.</s>
<s docid="AP900424-0096" num="15" wdcount="32"> Discovery, trailing an arc of white 
smoke into a brilliant blue sky, carried the silver-colored telescope to an 
orbit 380 miles above Earth _ higher by 70 miles than any previous shuttle.</s>
<s docid="AP900421-0075" num="28" wdcount="17"> The observatory is considered the 
greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo first used a telescope in 1609.</s>
<s docid="AP900424-0096" num="29" wdcount="19"> The telescope is 43 feet long and 14 
feet in diameter, about the size of a railroad tank car.</s>
<s docid="AP900424-0096" num="31" wdcount="30"> It is named after the late astronomer 
Edwin P. Hubble, who theorized that the universe was expanding and that the 
farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is traveling.</s>
<s docid="AP900424-0096" num="32" wdcount="24"> That gave support to the theory that a

94.5 inches in diameter, the other 12 inches.</s>
<s docid="AP900424-0096" num="36" wdcount="14"> Two of the instruments are cameras, 
two are spectrometers and one is a photometer.</s>
<s docid="AP900424-0048" num="33" wdcount="23"> During its 15-year working lifetime, 
the telescope will provide astronomers with 10 times better resolution and 25 
times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.</s>
<s docid="AP900425-0146" num="13" wdcount="26"> Discovery's astronauts overcame balky 
equipment to send the Hubble Space Telescope floating free from the shuttle 
today on a 15-year quest for secrets of the universe.</s>
<s docid="AP900425-0146" num="17" wdcount="26"> The final hours before its release 
were a nightmare for ground controllers as they commanded the unfurling of two 
solar panels that power the telescope's instruments.</s>
<s docid="AP900425-0146" num="18" wdcount="13"> The starboard panel balked twice as it 
was being pulled from its reel.</s>
<s docid="AP900425-0146" num="20" wdcount="10"> But there was a third try and it was 
successful.</s>
<s docid="AP900425-0198" num="15" wdcount="28"> The $1.5 billion telescope was 
released at 3:38 p.m. EDT as the shuttle entered its 20th orbit of Earth, nearly 
two hours and one orbit later than planned.</s>
<s docid="AP900427-0083" num="12" wdcount="34"> The lens cover on the Hubble Space 
Telescope opened today after a morning of worrisome problems, and Mission

$1.5 billion instrument.</s>
<s docid="AP900427-0146" num="12" wdcount="32"> The Hubble Space Telescope orbited 
with its big eye open Friday after ground controllers overcame communications 
problems and lifted its lens cover, but its electronics were shut down due to a 
malfunction.</s>
