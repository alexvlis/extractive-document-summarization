A State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters spokesman said flooding in 
central and south China have subsided.

Heavy June storms caused flooding in Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Fujiang and 
Zhejiang provinces. 

In Guangdong, the Beijiang and Xijiang rivers peaked at 14.72 meters and 25.91 meters, 
respectively. The Beijiang level was a record; the Xijiang peak was 25.91 meters above 
the danger level. Over 200 people died and 1.2 million hectares of crops were ruined.
In Hunan, the Xiangijiang River flooded Changsha, affecting over 300,000 residents and 
closing over 400 factories and 5,000 shops.

Jiangxi, a major agricultural province, was flooded by the Ganjiang River, while in 
Fujian, the floods exacerbated the typically low grain production. Approximately 446,000 
mu of crops in Fujiang were lost and 1.957 million mu of grain have been heavily hit.  

The Xunjiang River flooded Guangxi's Wuzhou city and its suburbs and knocked out 
telecommunications. 

Many officials, including Comrade Wen Jiabo (CPC Central Committee Secretariat 
member), toured the flooded areas. They praised the soldiers, police officers and civilians 
who battled the floods, saved key infrastructure and industrial resources, and assisted the 
victims. The people were urged to concentrate on recovery efforts and actions to 
minimize economic losses.</SUM>
