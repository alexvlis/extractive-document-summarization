the Xi Jiang, Bei Jiang, Xiang Jiang, and Gan Jiang rivers are dropping.

The Xi Jiang and Bei Jiang, in Guangdong Province, crested yesterday, the Bei Jiang at a 
record 10.39 meters. The industrialized Zhujiang Delta, however, is still threatened 
because it is traversed by a merged Xi Jiang and Bei Jiang.

reinforcement, therefore, must be accelerated.
