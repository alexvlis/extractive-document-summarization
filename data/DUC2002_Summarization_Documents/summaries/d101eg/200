Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev returned to power as the coup against him collapsed while 
he was vacationing in Crimea. The coup unraveled swiftly as the junta was unable to cope with 
thousands of people who erected barricades around Yeltsin's stronghold, the Russian Parliament. 
The national legislature demanded Gorbachev's reinstatement and nullified the coup leaders' 
decrees. The Communist Party, seeking to salvage its image, denounced the takeover. The coup 
people thought they could take over by neutralizing Gorbachev.

However, the real issue was not Gorbachev but the new political culture of freedom and 
democracy his reforms had created. Gorbachev initiated the changes but his standing was 
transformed when he was trumped by Russia's President Boris Yeltsin who, unlike Gorbachev, 
challenged the Communist Party and stayed close to the Russian people. Gorbachev and Yeltsin 
at first appeared as equals while launching a purge of the Communist Party, although Gorbachev 
balked at Yeltsin's proposals to ban the Communist Party. Later, Yeltsin made it clear in the 
Russian Parliament that Gorbachev has authority only if agreeing to share power and intensify 
the march toward a democracy and a free economy.

There is speculation that Gorbachev orchestrated the coup in order to ferret out the disloyal.</SUM>
