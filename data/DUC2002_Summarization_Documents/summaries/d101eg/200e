<s docid="SJMN91-06234109" num="5" wdcount="27"> Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev 
was said to be back in power today and returning to Moscow as the coup against

believed that by neutralizing Gorbachev and threatening everyone else, they 
could quickly take charge of the country.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="6" wdcount="37"> With the old order of Bolshevik power and ideology in ruins, 
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev demanded the resignation Friday of his entire 
government and Russian President Boris Yeltsin shut down Communist Party 
organizations throughout the vast republic.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="13" wdcount="49"> In a joint appearance with Gorbachev in 
the Russian parliament, broadcast live on Soviet television, Yeltsin made it 
clear that the Soviet president can maintain a semblance of authority only if he 
agrees to share power and intensify the march toward a democratic political 
system and a market economy.</s>
