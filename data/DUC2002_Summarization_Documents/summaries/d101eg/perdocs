This week's events in the Soviet Union have Kremlinologists who dabble in conspiracy theories 
working overtime.  One said, "Once you have a palace coup, the possibilities are endless." One 
intriguing scenario has Gorbachev hatching a false coup in order to step out of the way while 
hard-liners and liberals battle each other.  The coup falls apart and Gorbachev returns to power 
stronger than before. Kremlin watchers said theorizing was fueled by the fact that tanks did not 
roll until hours after Gorbachev's arrest, President Yeltsin was not arrested, Leningrad was left 
alone and, reportedly, many of the tanks had no ammunition.</SUM>

Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was said to be back in power today as the coup against him 
collapsed.  The coup, one of the most tumultuous developments in recent Soviet history, 
unraveled in a series of swift and dramatic developments.  Tanks moved away from the Russian 
parliament, scene of the worst violence of the coup.  The national legislature demanded 
Gorbachev's reinstatement and nullified the coup leaders' decrees.  The Communist Party, 
seeking to salvage its image, denounced the takeover.

The coup's failure dealt a fatal blow to high-level efforts to thwart reform drives by Gorbachev 
and Boris Yeltsin.  However, Latvia joined Estonia in declaring independence from the Soviet 
Union.</SUM>

Soviet President Gorbachev was prepared to head back to Moscow to reclaim power after the 
hard-line coup against him while he vacationed in Crimea collapsed.  The three-day coup 
unraveled in a serious of developments after the junta was unable to cope with thousands of 
people who erected barricades around Yeltsin's stronghold in the parliament and clashed with 
Soviet troops.

The Communist Party, seeking to salvage its image, denounced the takeover.  The Baltic 
republics bore the brunt of the post-coup crackdown.  As Soviet troops left, Latvia and Estonia 
declared immediate independence.  The Soviet Union's future depends now on who remains in 
power.</SUM>

President Mikhail Gorbachev furiously denounced the plotters who briefly overthrew him but 
said their failure could be an "enormous opportunity" to further his democratic reforms.  He 
detailed his purge of the coup leaders and pledged cooperation with and praised Russian 
Republic President Boris Yeltsin and said he did not plan to leave the Communist Party.

While in confinement in Crimea during the ouster, Gorbachev said his captors cut off all 
communications and his only source of news was foreign broadcasts.  He refused demands that 
he resign and prepared himself and his family for the possibility they would be killed.</SUM>

US Intelligence officials, a week before the Soviet coup, warned the White House that Soviet 
hard-liners might act to block the signing of the new Union Treaty although they knew too little 
to enable President Bush to act.

Predictably, the hard-liners would fail because opposition to the coup was against "the illegality 
of the principle" of usurping power, and fear that if Gorbachev could be "rolled up" other 
democratically elected officials could be too.  Gorbachev will become a figurehead, abandon the 
Party because it is "dead" and move more aggressively toward reform.  Restraints on cooperation 
with the West will weaken.</SUM>

The "coup people" thought they could take over by neutralizing Gorbachev and threatening 
everyone.  However, to the people the real issue was not Gorbachev but the new political culture 
of freedom and democracy that his reforms had created.  The Soviets resisted the putsch and 
created a new, decentralized and smaller Soviet Union quicker than anticipated. Gorbachev 
initiated the changes and history will credit him for that. His standing, however, was transformed 
when he was trumped by Boris Yeltsin who, unlike Gorbachev, challenged the Communist Party 
with eagerness and stayed close to the Russian people, who made him a formidable political 
force.</SUM>

Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin, appearing to act as equals, launched a sweeping purge of 
the Communist Party today.  Gorbachev fired his foreign minister and named a new head of the 
KGB. Yeltsin fired the heads of state-owned media. All of Moscow's Communist Party 
buildings were sealed as protesters blockaded the Party headquarters to prevent removal of 
document linking Party members with the coup.

Gorbachev affirmed Yeltsin's decrees to ban party activities in the Russian republic, the police 
and KGB, but balked at proposals to ban the Communist Party.  It wasn't clear whether 
Gorbachev had intended to back Yeltsin's decrees.</SUM>

Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin, meeting for the first time since the coup collapsed, 
pressed ahead with a sweeping purge of coup supporters.  Gorbachev said at the Russian 
Parliament that the government would prosecute those responsible for the takeover.  He accused 
the Communist Party Central Committee of panicking during the coup, and threw out his foreign 
minister.

Yeltsin, who led the nationwide coup resistance, suspended six Communist Party newspapers 
and nationalized printing presses in the Russian Republic. The Communist Party was banned 
from the KGB.

Gorbachev said he would meet with the leaders of the nine republics supporting the Union 
Treaty.</SUM>

Boris Yeltsin is showing himself to be at least the political equal, if not the master, of Mikhail 
Gorbachev.  In a joint appearance in the Russian Parliament, Yeltsin made it clear that 
Gorbachev has authority only if agreeing to share power and intensify the march toward 
democracy and a market economy. Yeltsin interrupted Gorbachev's speech and aggressively 
announced a decree had been signed suspending the activity of the Russian Communist Party.
Yeltsin later showed Gorbachev the minutes of a Council of Ministers meeting, which showed 
his allies had betrayed him.  Gorbachev promptly announced the "whole government has to 
resign."</SUM>

A specialist in Soviet affairs has written an article asking the question: "Did Mikhail Gorbachev 
orchestrate the coup that almost overthrew him?" Some views supporting this conspiracy theory 
are: Gorbachev ignored clear warnings about attempts to seize power; his description of his three 
days under arrest in the Crimea invites the question of why his 32 guards didn't act against the 
opposition delegation and why weren't they incapacitate; he may have sided with the 
conspirators but waited out self-imposed confinement.  His motives were to ferret out disloyal 
elements, make himself a hero, and delay signing of a treaty lessening his powers.</SUM>
