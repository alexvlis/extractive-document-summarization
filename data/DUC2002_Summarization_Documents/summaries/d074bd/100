Clarence Thomas completed five grueling days of testimony, apparently well on his way 
to becoming the second black justice in the history of the Supreme Court.  Several 
committee members say they expect the committee to recommend confirmation.  
Thomas, a federal judge, was picked by President Bush to replace Thurgood Marshall, 
the high court's only black justice.  Supporters and opponents of the nomination 
representative conservative and liberal camps respectively.  Thomas is supported by 
conservative groups and opposed by abortion rights and civil rights groups.  He and his 
wife have opposed affirmative action programs, but during the hearings, Thomas refused 
to give his views on abortion.</SUM>
