Frustrated Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee say that Supreme Court 
nominee Clarence Thomas is evasive, but no groundswell of opposition to his 
confirmation is emerging.  Thomas, a black federal judge was picked by President Bush 
to replace the retiring Thurgood Marshall, the high court's only black justice.  Thomas 
said he believed the right to marital privacy was "fundamental", but he refused to give his 
views on the 1973 abortion decision based on a woman's right to privacy.  On affirmative 
action he said there should be no preferences, goals, timetables or quotas.  On school 
prayer, he said, "Any policy of exclusion should be considered inappropriate".</SUM>

Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas told the Senate Judiciary Committee that it is 
"irrelevant"
 whether he holds any personal opinion on abortion, spurring new frustration 
among the committee's democrats.  Thomas' answers frustrated the committee's 
Democrats who say Thomas he is evasive.  Several Senators were openly skeptical over 
Thomas' insistence that he has no opinion on the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing 
abortion.  The black federal judge also said that regarding affirmative action we should 
have no preferences, goals, timetables or quotas.  He also said that natural law is nothing 
more than the background to our Constitution.</SUM>

Clarence Thomas completed five grueling days of Senate questioning apparently well on 
his way to becoming the second black justice in the history of the Supreme Court.  
Several committee members said that they expected the committee to recommend by a 
10-4 or 9-5 vote, to confirm.  Several liberal Democrats accused Thomas of being evasive 
and of disavowing many statements he made while an official of the Reagan and Bush 
administrations. The American Bar Association evaluation committee told the senators 
that Thomas' articles were deficient in presentation, content, scholarship and analysis.  
But those limitations were outweighed by his performance on the Court of Appeals.</SUM>
