Clarence Thomas completed five grueling days of Senate questioning, apparently well on 
his way to becoming the second black justice in the history of the Supreme Court.  
Thomas, a federal judge was picked by President Bush to replace the retiring Thurgood 
Marshall, the high court's only black justice.  Several committee members said they 
expected the committee to recommend confirmation.  Several Democrats accused 
Thomas of being evasive and of disavowing many statements he made while an official 
of the Reagan and Bush administration.  Those who support the nomination include 
conservative groups such as The Restoration of the Black Family and Society and 
opposition came from women's and civil rights groups such as the national Abortion 
Right's Action League and the Lawyer's Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.   
Thomas and his wife Virginia, who is white, have opposed affirmative action programs.
During the hearings Thomas refused to give his views on the 1973 abortion decision 
based on a woman's right to privacy.  On school prayer, he said "any policy of exclusion 
should considered inappropriate.  Virginia Thomas has drawn criticism for her lobbying 
against comparable worth legislation and religious rights groups are troubled by her anti-
cult activities following her involvement with Lifespring, a motivational group.</SUM>
