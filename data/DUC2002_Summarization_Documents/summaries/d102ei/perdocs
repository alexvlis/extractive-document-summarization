Lucille Ball was born August 6, 1911, in Jamestown, New York.  She began, in 1926, as 
a chorus girl and moved to Hollywood in 1933, appearing in over 75 films.  She married 
Desi Arnaz in 1940 and, in 1951, they formed Desilu Productions and began "I Love 
Lucy."  When Lucy and Desi divorced in 1960, Lucy bought Desi's share of the company 
and sold it in 1967 for $18 million.  In 1961, she married Gary Morton and next year 
started "The Lucy Show", which became "Here's Lucy" and ended in 1974.  She later 
starred in two movies and another, short-lived, TV show.</SUM>

Keith Thibodeaux, who played Little Ricky on the "I Love Lucy" show, remembered 
Lucille Ball on Wednesday, following the announcement of her death.  Thibodeaux grew 
up on the set playing the role from 1956 to 1961.  He said he saw more of Lucy than his 
parents.  Thibodeaux is a professional drummer but auditioned for the Ricky role when 
he was 6.  He remembers Lucy saying "that's him" and he was signed to a seven-year 
contract, using the name Richard Keith.  He recalls Lucy as being very serious, in 
control, and very strict, but with a lot of love and generosity.</SUM>

Lucille Ball was mourned Wednesday in her western New York hometown she left more 
than 50 years ago.  Miss Ball died earlier in Los Angeles.  Pauline Lopus recalled that 
Miss Ball dreamed of fame, worked as an amusement park barker at age 15, and appeared 
in school plays.  After becoming a model, Miss Ball moved to Hollywood in 1933.  She 
kept contacts in Jamestown and was going to visit on May 20 to receive an honorary 
degree from the community college and have a street renamed for her in nearby Celoron, 
where she grew up.  These honors now will be awarded posthumously.</SUM>

Lucille Ball, the pioneering queen of television comedy, died Wednesday at 77 of a 
ruptured abdominal artery.  She had been recovering steadily from heart surgery at 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center when the aorta burst, sending her into cardiac arrest.  
Accolades immediately poured in from friends, former co-workers, and Presidents.  She 
and her first husband, Desi Arnaz, produced and co-starred on the precedence setting "I 
Love Lucy", one of the most popular TV shows ever.  She was born in New York, 
became a model, then appeared in 75 plus movies.  In recent years her career slowed and 
she last performed at the March Academy Awards.</SUM>

Lucille Ball was the movies' greatest gift to television.  Signed by Sam Goldwyn in 1933, 
Lucy perfected her comedic skills in dozens of films, frequently appearing as the salty 
second banana.  Her superb timing and physical and verbal comedy skills continue to 
shine on "I Love Lucy" reruns.  Reruns made possible because her husband, Desi Arnaz, 
pioneered filming the show, using three cameras.  Lucy was the dynamo who, backed by 
exceptional writing, editing, casting and supporting performances, created the most 
durable TV show in history.  Lucille Ball was not the scatterbrained Lucy, but a smart 
perfectionist, who knew the world was better off laughing.</SUM>

Gail Gordon, Lucille Ball's sidekick through radio and television, said "the world will 
miss her greatly."  He said he will remember her as the best talent of her kind and a warm 
and wonderful friend.  They first met in 1947 on her radio program "My Favorite 
Husband."  He joined her on television from 1962 to 1974.  He last spoke with Miss Ball 
on his birthday in February.  Gordon, 81, performs in dinner theatres in Edmonton, 
Canada, and regrets that he will not be able to attend her funeral because of obligations to 
his current production.</SUM>

Lucille Ball never knew how great she was.  She never bragged or exercised her 
considerable power.  When she was praised for "I Love Lucy" she always diverted credit 
to her husband, the writers, and the co-stars.  While the writing, cast and production were 
marvelous, Lucy's performance added the quantum force.  In an interview late in life, she 
revealed an ambivalence to the show, primarily because her marriage was ending.  She 
did not reach her comedy potential until she was 40 and started on television.  She 
declared TV was the medium for her and anyone else who wanted quick success.</SUM>

Sympathy poured out following the death of Lucille Ball at age 77.  She died at Cedars-
Sinai Medical Center from a ruptured aorta, eight days after heart surgery.  A private 
burial, with no funeral service, is planned.  Jane Curtin, Joan Rivers, Whoopi Goldberg, 
Tim Conway, and Victoria Jackson were among comedians lauding her talents, personal 
example, and shows.  President Bush praised her "gift of love" as well as laughter, and 
former President and Mrs. Reagan called her an "American institution."  A friend in her 
hometown of Celoron, N.Y., said she was a big star "but still just Lucy to us."</SUM>
