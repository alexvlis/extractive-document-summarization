Former East German leader Erich Honecker was under house arrest outside East Berlin since 
being ousted in October 1989. Honecker and other party officials have been investigated for 
corruption and treason. After hospitalization for kidney surgery, he was arrested and imprisoned 
to await trial. Judged too ill for imprisonment but fit enough for prosecution, he was placed in a 
Soviet East Berlin hospital.

In August, Honecker was interrogated about his role in the killing of some 200 people trying to 
escape from East Berlin. A murder charge would put him away for life. His trial was delayed 
because of East German-West German merger negotiations. In December, Soviet authorities 
refused to return him to Germany claiming it would "burden" Moscow and Bonn's "outstanding 
relations."

In December 1991, Honecker took refuge in the Chilean Embassy in Moscow. Gorbachev was 
his protector until his political fortunes declined and he ordered Honecker to leave the country. 
He was tried and imprisoned in Germany in early 1992 but was released in 1993. He traveled to 
Santiago, Chile to join his daughter who had married a Chilean. He lived with his wife in a 
wealthy Santiago area where he died in 1994 at age 81.</SUM>
