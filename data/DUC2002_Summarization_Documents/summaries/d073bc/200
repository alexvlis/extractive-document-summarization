After slumbering for 600 years, the Mt. Pinatubo volcano erupted in June 1991. Mt. 
Pinatubo is on the Philippine Island of Luzon. It first erupted on 9 June, and the eruptions 
continued through the 14th, with as many as six eruptions on one day. The Philippine 
Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology, and the United States Geological Survey said 
the volcanic activity was increasing in a way that suggested a more massive eruption 
would occur. Heavy rain increased the danger of mudslides.

The mountain shot out gases, rock and ash. Mushroom clouds ascended to heights of ten 
miles. The gray-green clouds turned day into night, and covered wide areas with ash. 
More than 19,000 panicked villagers within a 12-mile radius were evacuated.

Clark Air Base, one of the largest U.S. overseas installations, is about ten miles from 
Pinatubo. Most airmen, dependents and civilian employees were evacuated to the U.S. 
Naval Base at Subic Bay on the 11th, following the first major eruption. The remaining 
personnel left a day or two later. Philippine President Aquino dismissed as a fabrication 
that she had been warned volcanic damage could cause a nuclear incident.</SUM>
