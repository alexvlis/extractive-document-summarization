Mount Pinatubo erupted Sunday, the first eruption in over 600 years, shooting out gases, 
rock and ash. Eruptions continued today, leaving the mountain enshrouded in thick gray 
clouds that rose to 12,000 feet. It had recently shown signs of activity, and Philippine 
scientists now say a catastrophe is possible. Rain last night raised the additional fear of 
mudslides.

Clark Air Force Base, one of the largest U.S. installations overseas, is ten miles from the 
mountain. Most airmen, dependents and civilian employees were evacuated to the U.S. 
Naval Base at Subic Bay, 50 miles from Clark.</SUM>

Five scientists of the United States Geological Survey, now located in a bunker 12 miles 
east of Mt. Pinatubo, are among the few still at Clark Air Base after the base was 
evacuated Monday in the wake of Pinatubo's eruption.

The volcano may already have done its worst, but a Geological Survey spokesman in 
California says the volcano's activity is increasing in a way that suggests a massive 
eruption is imminent. A massive eruption could cause searing avalanches that would 
completely cover Clark. In that case, even personnel caught in a cloud of ash would 
perish.</SUM>

Six eruptions rocked Mt. Pinatubo today, with the first coming at 8:40 A.M. A huge 
plume of ash rose from the mountain.  About 3,000 tribesmen scampered for safety with 
their belongings and livestock. An aerial gunnery range at Clark Air Base was covered 
with ash. The molted rock flowed into rivers, and no damage has yet been reported.

Residents of Angeles, a city of 300,000 thousand, panicked when the gray-green cloud 
turned day into night. The Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology has said 
that larger eruptions could occur, but authorities have not yet ordered the evacuation of 
Angeles.</SUM>

Three major new eruptions rocked Mt. Pinatubo late Wednesday and early today. Heavy 
rain increased the threat of mudslides. One eruption was so strong that it sent 
seismograph needles off the chart.

Wednesday's eruptions caused U.S. officials to order further evacuations from Clark Air 
Base. Those left behind to guard the base and service sensitive communications 
equipment when most left Monday were told to leave.

Philippine Civil Defense officials evacuated more than 19,000 from villages within a 12- 
mile radius of Pinatubo. Philippine President Aquino released 14.2 million dollars for 
relief efforts.</SUM>

Five explosions shook Mt. Pinatubo Friday, spreading ash over Clark, and as far away as 
Manila. Friday's blasts were part of the same eruption, the largest since Pinatubo awoke 
Sunday from a 600-year slumber. Typhoon Yunya, packing 60 MPH winds, hit the east 
coast of Luzon, which includes Mt. Pinatubo, but quickly weakened to a tropical storm.

The U.S. military began flying home some of the 28,000 Americans crowded into Subic 
Bay Naval Base. Philippine President Aquino dismissed as a fabrication a report that said 
she had been warned volcanic damage could case a nuclear incident at Clark.</SUM>
