Erich Honecker, former head of East Germany, died on 29 May 1994 in Santiago Chile. 
He had been living there since his release from prison in 1993.  Honecker and his regime 
were toppled in October 1989,  by  pro-democracy demonstrators, leading to the eventual 
unification of East and West Germany.  He, along with several members of his Politburo, 
were arrested and charges with treason, corruption, and abuse of power.  Honecker was 
also charged with manslaughter, stemming from his orders, which resulted in the deaths 
of East Germans attempting to flee to the West.  Honecker ruled East Germany for 18 
years by using extreme repression.</SUM>
