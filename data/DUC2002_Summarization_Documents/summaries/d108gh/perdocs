Iraq's deputy UN representative says Iraq has no objective concerning its invasion of 
Kuwait and wishes only cordial relations with it. The Kuwaitis will determine their own 
future and Iraqi forces will withdraw as soon as order has been restored. Kuwait's UN 
ambassador says Iraq's pretext for invading an independent, sovereign state is false and 
flimsy. If not deterred by the UN in a decisive manner, all international relations will be 
threatened. No country will be safe. President Bush says, "We remain committed to take 
whatever actions are necessary to defend our longstanding, vital interests in the [Persian] 
Gulf."</SUM>

By a 13-0 vote (Cuba and Yemen abstaining), the UN approved trade and military 
sanctions against Iraq, including a ban on oil purchases, as punishment for invading 
Kuwait. Iraq reacted by rounding up Britons, Americans and West Germans in Kuwait, 
taking some to Iraq. Saddam Hussein ordered evacuation drills in Baghdad in case of US 
or Israeli attacks.  Many Kuwaitis fled to Saudi Arabia. Oil prices soared to a four-year 
high. One reason for invading Kuwait was Kuwaiti reluctance to slow its oil flow to 
create higher prices, which Iraq was pressing for to rebuild its war-damaged economy 
and settle $80 billion in foreign debts.</SUM>

Iranian newspapers rejoice that the world is waking up to Saddam Hussein, saying they 
warned Frankenstein would torment his creators. Khomeini vowed for years to unseat 
him. Saddam attacked Iran in 1980 and they fought until 1988. Saddam boasts Iraq alone 
staunched the tide of radical Islam. Iran says the US planned it all and conspired with 
Saddam to undermine the Islamic revolution.  Kuwait supported Iraq and reflagged 
tankers in the US, prompting the US Navy's arrival in the Persian Gulf, a US goal. One 
reason Iraq invaded Kuwait was its demand that Iraq pay back billions loaned during the 
war Saddam says he fought for all Arabs.</SUM>

Japan and Cyprus, highly dependent on Middle East petroleum, and non-member 
Switzerland joined the UN-sanctioned boycott of oil from Iraq and Kuwait to convince 
Iraq to withdraw troops from Kuwait. Sanctions forbid any activity that helps Iraq or

Mediterranean, carrying half of Iraq's crude output. The EEC froze assets and suspended 
oil purchases and arms sales. Denmark, Norway and Sweden embargoed trade. China, a
