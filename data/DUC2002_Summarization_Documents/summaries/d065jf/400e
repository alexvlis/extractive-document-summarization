<s docid="AP880817-0040" num="13" wdcount="27"> The Quayle family and friends were
celebrating Tuesday afternoon after George Bush announced he wants the
41-year-old Indiana senator to be the Republican nominee for vice
president.</s>

<s docid="AP880817-0040" num="19" wdcount="31"> Dan Quayle, who grew up in
Huntington, graduated from DePauw University, a small liberal arts college
in Greencastle, Ind., before going to work in the Indiana attorney general's
office in 1970.</s>

<s docid="AP880818-0023" num="9" wdcount="23"> Dan Quayle has not yet been
nominated for vice president and already Republicans are comparing him to
Thomas Jefferson and John F. Kennedy.</s>

<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="28" wdcount="27"> Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, who
placed Quayle's name in nomination, stressed his campaign skills and sought
to deflect concerns that he lacked experience for the job.</s>

<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="10" wdcount="33"> Encumbered by his image as a
political novice who needed a bevy of professional handlers to survive early
campaign controversies, Quayle enters a Bush administration in which he has
few intimates or allies.</s>

<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="16" wdcount="36"> When asked, Bush employed the
stock lines that Quayle would ``make an outstanding vice president'' and had
been ``tempered by steel'' as he weathered the early furor over his military
service, academic record and personal life.</s>

<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="31" wdcount="28"> Democrats portrayed Quayle during
the campaign as a lightweight, a man with little or no legislative
accomplishments, untested and unqualified to be a heartbeat away from the
presidency.</s>

<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="33" wdcount="34"> Quayle didn't help his case by
making a number of celebrated gaffes during the campaign, perhaps the worst
being his garbled explanation of the Holocaust and his declaration, ``I
didn't live in this century''.</s>

<s docid="LA111289-0035" num="8" wdcount="18"> One year after his election, Dan
Quayle has achieved all he ever wanted: He has become dull .</s>

<s docid="LA111289-0035" num="19" wdcount="22"> So when Quayle got to Washington,
he got there with one goal: Support the President and make himself a very
small target.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06140099" num="33" wdcount="31"> Nonetheless, most of
Huntington's 17,000 residents have rallied around their native son for the
exhibition, which tracks his life from infancy through law school, from the
Senate to the vice presidency.</s>

<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="11" wdcount="48"> Relegated in the campaign to small
towns and safe GOP areas, Quayle as vice president is likely to be given a
traditional ceremonial role _ going to political gatherings and state
funerals _ rather than the advisory role that Walter Mondale and even Bush
had, some scholars feel.</s>

<s docid="AP880817-0040" num="22" wdcount="24"> Friends said the Quayles are
devoted to their three children and prefer quiet nights at home to nights
out on the town in Washington.</s>
