George Bush's choice of Dan Quayle as his running mate surprised most
political observers, but was quickly supported by many of Quayle's fellow
Republican senators. Quayle was viewed as a lightweight and questions were
raised about his military service and errors in his official resume. His
main attributes were party loyalty and identification as a devoted family
man.  Quayle contributed little to the campaign and, after being elected,
all but disappeared from the political scene.  President Bush, however,
continued to voice support for, and confidence in Quayle.  His friends,
especially in his home town, called him a winner.</SUM>
