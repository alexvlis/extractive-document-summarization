Checkpoint Charlie was lifted into history today during a ceremony including the foreign 
ministers of the four World War II allies. Secretary of State Baker, citing Checkpoint 
Charlie as a symbol of the Cold War, hoped its removal would bury the conflicts it 
created. Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze, the first Soviet foreign minister to visit 
Berlin, called for a removal of Berlin's status as an allied controlled city. Checkpoint 
Charlie became superfluous when the East Germany overthrew its communist-controlled 
government and the border between East and West Germany was opened. Although the 
ceremony was closed to the public, residents of the street watched from their windows.</SUM>
