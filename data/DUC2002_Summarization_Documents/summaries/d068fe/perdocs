As the U.S. Army band played a song about old Berlin, a crane hoisted the rectangular 
white sentry station known as Checkpoint Charlie onto a waiting truck. For 29 years, 
Checkpoint Charlie served as the Allied checkpoint at the only place between the Berlins 
that could be crossed on foot by non-Germans.  Citing Checkpoint Charlie as a symbol of 
the Cold War, Secretary of State Baker hoped its removal would "bury the conflicts it 
created."  Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze called for the removal of Berlin's status 
as an allied controlled city. All borders between the Berlins are to be opened on July 2nd.</SUM>

In an elaborate ceremony attended by six foreign ministers, numerous generals, a brass 
band and hundreds of reporters, Checkpoint Charlie was lifted on to a flatbed truck and 
consigned to history. Although the public was not invited to the ceremony, residents of 
the street overlooking the checkpoint watched from their windows. One resident said she 
saw eight people shot to death attempting to escape and at least 20 successful attempts.  
Cars, balloons and tunnels were used to escape East Berlin. One man, Andreas Bratke, 
just ran. "I ran as fast as I could," he said.</SUM>

Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Schevardnadze outlined the Soviet proposal allowing a 
united Germany to join NATO after a five-year transition period.  The proposal came 
during international talks in East Berlin on the strategic future of a united Germany. The 
U.S. and its NATO allies object to the proposal. The proposal also called for the 
departure of Western troops from West Berlin within six months as well as a 50 percent 
reduction of the troops of all fours nations in the country within five years, eventually 
reducing them further to a level of token contingents or completely withdrawing from 
Germany.</SUM>

A ceremony held on Friday and attended by Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet 
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze as well as their colleagues from France, Britain, 
and the two Germanys marked the removal of Checkpoint Charlie, the allied checkpoint 
20 yards from the crossing into East Berlin. The envoys from the two German states and 
the four World War II allies were in Berlin to discuss German reunification.  Checkpoint 
Charlie became superfluous last Fall when East Germany overthrew its communist 
government and the German borders were opened. As sections of the wall continue to be 
torn down the U.S. decided two weeks ago to remove Checkpoint Charlie.</SUM>

Attended by a brass band and the foreign ministers of the four World War II allies, 
Checkpoint Charlie was lifted into history today. Checkpoint Charlie was erected after 
Communist East Germany built the Berlin Wall and it came to symbolize the Cold War. 
Attendance by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, the first visit of a Soviet 
foreign minister to Berlin, was seen as a gesture of reconciliation. Former West German 
Chancellor Willy Brandt, who challenged the building of the wall in the 1960s as Mayor 
of Berlin, sat in the front row of attendees. Checkpoint Charlie's cobblestone foundation 
disappeared to souvenir hunters after the ceremony.</SUM>
