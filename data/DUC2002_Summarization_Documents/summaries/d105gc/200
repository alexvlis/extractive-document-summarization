Disputes between ethnic groups broke out in parts of the Soviet Union two years before 
its dissolution. Gorbachev decried the unrest, but admitted that early Soviet efforts to 
fashion a unified culture out of a melange of more than 100 ethnic groups using 100 
languages was a cause of the current troubles. In the two years preceding June 1990 the 
Kremlin had dispatched troops to quell fighting in 13 regions. There had been unrest in 
Kirghizia and Uzbekistan, and serious fighting in Georgia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan

The demise of the Soviet Union touched off new ethnic conflicts. Those already 
underway worsened. Armenia and Azerbaijan fought over an enclave of Armenians 
within Azerbaijan. A group in South Ossetia wanted out of Georgia. Minorities of ethnic 
Russians and Ukrainians fought for rights in Moldavia.

In late 1992 Russia sent specially trained troops to halt fighting in the Caucasus 
Mountains and in Tajikistan. The dangerous conflicts in the former Soviet Union worried 
the international community. There was fear that the area would be destabilized.   

By May 1994 the number killed in Tajikistan reached 100,00. The Communist Party 
leader said only a restored Soviet Union could deal with the ethnic fighting.</SUM>
