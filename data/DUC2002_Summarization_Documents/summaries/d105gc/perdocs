The six-month conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagoro-Karabakh, an 
enclave of Armenians of Armenians living within Azerbaijan, is one of the most 
rancorous domestic disputes faced by Gorbachev since he became president. On Friday 
he decried the unrest and proposed legislation to punish Soviets who kindle ethnic unrest 
He made other proposals to resolve ethnic tensions, including an increase in power for 
each of the country's 15 republics, and a law on the "equal use" of the more than 100 
languages of the Soviet Union.

Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, countries forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union, 
have demanded more control of their affairs.</SUM>

President Gorbachev warned Saturday that growing ethnic unrest across the Soviet Union 
was endangering the political and economic reforms, and even threatening the nation's 
existence. He acknowledged that the early Soviet effort to pull the 100-plus ethnic groups 
into a unified culture was a cause of the present strife.

Last month troops were sent to Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia to maintain order. 
Groups in Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania are advocating secession. One hundred died last 
month in vicious assaults against Mesketian Turks in Uzbekistan, and there is new 
violence in an area of Georgia populated be Azerbaijanis.</SUM>

The Tatars of the Crimea and the ethnic Germans who lived along the Volga were 
forcibly resettled by Stalin. They were sent to Siberia and Central Asia, and now they 
want to return to their traditional homeland. The government has decided to give each of 
each of the groups an autonomous region in their homeland, but it will be years before 
they can be relocated. The Russians who have settled in those areas, and wish to remain 
there must be accommodated before the Tatars and the Germans can return to the Volga.</SUM>

Moldavia agreed on Sunday to comply with the Kremlin's order to reconsider its law 
making the Moldavian language the republic's official language. Moldavia borders 
Romania, and the Moldavian language is identical to Romanian except for the Cyrillic 
script that Stalin imposed on the republic. Gorbachev gave Moldavia ten days to fashion 
measures insuring the rights of minorities. A group 150,000 Turkish Christians, and 
groups of Russians and Ukrainians living in Moldavia claim to be victims of 
discrimination. They want autonomy. Hard-liners want Gorbachev to declare a state of 
emergency in the ethnically and geographically diverse republic.</SUM>

The large majority of the authorities in Moldavia are ethnic Romanians. The cease-fire 
between them and the Russian-speaking minority was short-lived. Most of the ethnic 
Russians live east of the Dnestr River and a shooting there broke the cease-fire. Russians 
and Ukrainians account for 27 percent, and Moldavians make up 64 percent of the small 
republic's population of four and a half million. The dispute started in 1989 as a language 
movement as Moldavia wanted to express their common ethnicity with Romania. This is 
a dispute that arose out of the Soviet Union's demise.</SUM>

Russia and Georgia yesterday deployed troops to stop the ethnic fighting in a seven 
kilometer-wide security zone separating rebel South Ossetia from the rest of Georgia. 
South Ossetia wants unification with North Ossetia that has been a part of Russia since 
Stalin's days This was the first peacekeeping attempt anywhere in the former Soviet 
Union, whose disintegration touched off waves of new ethic conflicts between the 
Afghan and Romanian borders. The mission of the peacekeepers is to form a physical 
barrier between the two sides. They wore United Nations-style blue helmets.</SUM>

Over the weekend Russia dispatched 3,000 special troops to halt ethnic fighting in the 
troubled Caucasus Mountains. Inguish rebels in North Ossetia were reported to have 
taken hostage 80 Interior Ministry soldiers based in the region. The Inguish, a regional 
ethnic group, are demanding return of lands that Stalin expropriated and declared part of 
North Ossetia.

This was the second recent troop deployment. Last week soldiers were sent to help crush 
a coup attempt in Tajikistan. Several other ethnic conflicts are continuing in republics of 
the former Soviet Union that are located in the Caucasus Mountains.</SUM>

In December 1993 the Foreign Ministers of Russia and The United Kingdom spoke out 
about the seriousness and the consequences of the ethnic and political conflicts in the 
former Soviet Union. They agreed that the disputes are a legitimate concern of Russians 
who are concerned about clashes close to their borders, and about the welfare of ethnic 
Russians living within the borders of the now independent states that had been part of the 
Soviet Union. Europe and the entire international community should share those concerns 
for humanitarian reasons and because continuing conflicts risk promoting regional 
instability and threats to European security.</SUM>

On 16 May 1994 the Tajik Communist Party called for the restoration of a rejuvenated 
Soviet Union in the form of a federation as the only way to restore order, and said a 
majority of Tajiks supported the call. The Communist Party leader said that the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union had led to economic and political chaos in all the 
republics. Last Saturday supporters of the restoration movement held a funding congress 
in Dushanbe, capital of Tajikistan. 

Ethnic conflicts have disrupted many republics, but Tajikistan was hit the hardest, with

Today a former USSR Supreme Soviet Deputy from Latvia said the adoption of the 
Latvian citizenship law violates human rights, and creates the conditions for a conflict 
like those in the Caucasus. He said the United States encouraged Latvia to pass the law 
discriminating against the Russian-speaking population of Latvia. He then went on to 
describe a convoluted scenario that has Russia supporting the law in order to create a 
situation that would later benefit Russia at Latvia's expense. He wouldn't or couldn't 
name the sources of the information on which the scenario was built.</SUM>
