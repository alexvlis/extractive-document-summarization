Floods being called the worst in 100 years have hit major parts of Guangdong, Guangxi, 
Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian and Zhejiang Provinces.  They were caused by torrential rains in 
the Xiangjiang, Xunjiang, Xijiang and Beijiang river valleys.  Cities most seriously 
affected where Changsha, Zhuzhou and Xiangtan in Hunan Province, Wuzhou in 
Guangxi Province and Sanming in Fujian Province. Central Party official Wen Jiabao
