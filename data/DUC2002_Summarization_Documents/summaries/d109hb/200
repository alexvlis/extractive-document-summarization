Floods being called the worst in 100 years have hit major parts of Guangdong, Guangxi, 
Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian and Zhejiang Provinces.  They were caused by torrential rains in 
the Xiangjiang, Xunjiang, Xijiang and Beijiang river valleys.  Cities most seriously 
affected where Changsha, Zhuzhou and Xiangtan in Hunan Province, Wuzhou in 
Guangxi Province and Sanming in Fujian Province. At the Changsha city monitoring 
station, the water level rose to 38.93 meters, some 0.56 meters above the previous record.  
500,000 soldiers and civilians fought to contain the floodwaters there.  In Wuzhou city, 
the Xunjiang River's floodwater speed was recorded at 46,200 cubic-meters-per-second, 
the most ferocious since the nation's founding in 1949.  In Guangzhou Province 200 
people died, 189,000 rooms were destroyed, and 1.2 million hectares of crops were 
ruined.  Economic losses were set at 10.2 billion yuan.  Many local, provincial and 
Central Party members provided support and expressed their concern, including 
Chairman Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng.  Noteworthy were the efforts of Central 
Party official Wen Jiabao.  He visited Changsha, Zhuzhou, Xiangtan and Jiangxi cities to 
offer appreciation, encouragement and guidance for the ongoing flood fighting and relief 
work, and to direct the resumption of industrial and agricultural production.</SUM>
