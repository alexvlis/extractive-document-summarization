Floods have hit Changsha, the capital of central China's Hunan Province following a 
succession of rainstorms in the upper and middle Xiangjiang River.  Late this afternoon 
the water level at the Changsha monitoring station had risen to 38.93 meters, some 0.56 
meters higher than ever previously recorded.  The water level is still rising sharply.  
Yesterday afternoon 19 dykes in the Changsha area collapsed affecting 128,000 residents.  
The Changsha city government has asked those in the endangered area to move to safer 
places.  So far, more than 500,000 soldiers and local residents are fighting the floods.  
Communist Party officials urge perseverance.</SUM>

chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Li Peng, premier of the State Council, 
are very concerned about floods in Guangdong Province.  They gave important directives 
for current flood prevention and disaster relief tasks in Guangdong.  They expressed their 
hope that under the leadership of the Guangdong provincial party committee and 
government, people would make concerted efforts to help flood victims solve their living 
problems, and go all out to battle the floods to ensure the safety of the Bei Jiang dike, 
Guangzhou city and the Zhu Jiang Delta.</SUM>

Floods continue to seriously affect Guangdong, Hunan and Jiangxi Provinces and the 
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.  At Wuzhou, a city on the Xunjiang River, the 
floodwater's speed was recorded at 46,200 cubic-meters-per-second, the most ferocious 
since the founding of New China in 1949.  The State Council, China's highest governing 
body, sent a joint working group of the Ministries of Water Resources, Construction and 
Civil Affairs to fight the floods in Guangxi and Guangdong.  In Changsha, more than 
300,000 residents were affected and more than 400 factories and 5000 shops were forced 
to close.  Meanwhile, drought continues throughout north and northeastern China.</SUM>

This morning Provincial Party Committee Secretary Wang Molin, provincial Governor 
Chen Bangzhu, and other party and government leaders arrived at Changsha City to 
direct the fight against the flooding.  Governor Chen Bangzhu said in an interview that 
this flood in Hunan province is of a severity unseen for the past 100 years in terms of 
both water level and quantity.  He said that efforts by Army personnel and the people 
have protected key dams, thereby keeping economic losses to a minimum.  However, the 
province's situation remains serious because forecasts indicate more rain will fall over 
the next several days.</SUM>

According to the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, after the largest 
or the second largest flood peaks since the liberation of China occurred a few days ago in 
the Xi Jiang, Bei Jiang, Xiang Jiang, and Gan Jiang rivers, water levels in these rivers are 
dropping slowly.  However, this does not mean that Guangdong's flooding has eased.  
The sea tide may add to the floodwater causing the Zhujiang Delta with its forest of 
factories to face its most rigorous flood test yet.  The situation in Xiang Jiang is also 
stabilized.  Dike reinforcing work needs to be done.</SUM>

Floods lasting for ten or more days have brought heavy agricultural losses to Fujian 
Province.  Among nine cities and prefectures there, those seriously hit are Sanming, 
Nanping, Ningde, Fuzhou, Quanzhou and Putian.  Of these, Sanming was hit the worst.  
In May the city suffered from heavy rainstorms and had big losses and it now suffers 
again from the flood with some 600,000 mu of crops damaged.  Per capita possession of 
cultivated land in Fujian is only 0.05 mu.  Even in normal years, grain output there is not 
self-sufficient.  This consecutive flooding has made things even more grim.</SUM>

Comrade Wen Jiabao and his party left Changsha yesterday to inspect the flooded areas 
of Zhuzhou and Xiangtan.  After listening to these two cities' flood fighting and relief 
reports, he spoke out.  He said that by their work, the cadres and people in Zhuzhou and 
Xiangtan rescued a large number of industrial and mining enterprises.  After the water 
recedes we should rebuild homes and repair the damaged dikes and embankments.  Since 
the peak flood season has not yet arrived we cannot slacken our efforts. There has been 
inadequate coordination between urban and rural flood control.  We should learn from 
this negative experience.</SUM>

The highest flood peaks on the Xijiang and Beijiang Rivers have passed, said Zhu Senlin, 
governor of south China's Guangdong Province.  No breaches of major embankments or 
reservoirs were reported despite the most serious flood in a hundred years.  Eleven 
million people in the province's nine cities and 55 counties were affected, more than 200 
people died, 189,000 rooms were destroyed and 1.2 million hectares of crops were ruined 
in this natural disaster.  Economic losses were set at 10.2 billion yuan.  The really bad 
news is that this is just the beginning.  The main flood season has not yet started.</SUM>

and to expand the planting of late-ripening rice and autumn grain in order to attain a

Floods that hit Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian and Zhejiang Provinces 
have all receded.  Caused by torrential rains in the Xijiang and Beijiang river valleys, the 
floods were the worst in 100 years.  The Guangdong provincial government urged 
localities to help victims with food, clothing, shelter and medical care so that no one 
would die and no epidemic disease would break out.  The province has allocated grain, 
cash and farm production supplies such as fertilizer and diesel fuel to the flood-stricken 
areas.  Central Party member Wen Jiabao said the key to mitigating economic loss is to 
resume production as soon as possible.</SUM>
