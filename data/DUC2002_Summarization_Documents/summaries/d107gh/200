In mid-July, 1988's drought looked record-breaking. Predictions were for month-long 
hot, dry weather in grain-growing states and rain elsewhere, and a 4% chance of three-
month recovery based on past-drought analysis. Rain was insufficient. Severe storms 
brought tornadoes, hail damage to crops, and lightning-sparked forest fires. Temperatures 
topped 100 and states issued heat alerts. Weather experts attending a Drought 
Symposium urged continued attention to climate, and energy policies to reduce the 
greenhouse effect. One theorized a relationship between drought and Jupiter's orbit. 
Crop declines were forecast and grain futures dropped. Adequate domestic and export 
supplies were expected. Higher prices would reduce consumption. Poor, food-importing 
countries would suffer most. Good harvests in Europe and Asia were projected. Georgia 
itemized hay sources. UPS, railroads, and truckers transported hay to Kentucky and Ohio 
for free. Congress proposed up to $100,000 aid to farmers. States provided funds for farm 
loans. President Reagan visited drought areas. Easing of 1989 crop acreage controls was 
considered. Farmers sued a company reneging on drought insurance. Drinking water was 
hauled to towns. Dam flow reductions endangered neighbors' supplies. Catch limits 
disappeared at reservoirs. Gamefish and turkeys were depleted. Livestock sales increased. 
Cannery jobs fell. Laying off mill workers and banning logging was considered. Few rain 
interruptions accelerated highway projects.</SUM>
