Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said the drought could cause crop acreage controls to 
be eased next year to help rebuild US grain inventories. More US territory suffered some 
degree of drought in May and June than at any point on record. On July 2, 35% of the 
contiguous US was experiencing severe to extreme drought, compared to 60% in 1934 
and 50% in 1954. Because of the extensive early season drought, this year's total affected 
area could set new records. However, there will still be adequate supplies of food grains 
and livestock feed to meet domestic and export demands. Consumption will be less 
because prices are higher.</SUM>

North America's crippling drought could result in food shortages for poor, food-
importing countries facing high grain prices. Food aid from developed countries could 
also fall. World cereal production in 1988 is expected to be 1.785 billion tons, only two 
million tons more than last year's lower-than-expected production. World grain stocks 
will likely fall below 310 million tons, or 17% of the level necessary to safeguard world 
food security. The most severely hit crops are coarse grains (maize, barley, oats). Good 
harvests in Europe and Asia are projected, but locusts flourishing in unexpectedly heavy 
rains have damaged sub-Saharan crops. South American grain production should be 
slightly lower.</SUM>

Government drought measures under consideration include payments up to $100,000 to 
drought-stricken farmers and easing 1989 crop acreage controls, but are called too slow. 
Iowa farmers still face disaster despite five inches of weekend rain. Barges with pumps 
will haul fresh water to towns affected by the lower Mississippi River's rising salt levels. 
A record expanse of US territory suffered drought in May and June.  In May, more 
money was withdrawn from savings accounts than deposited for the first time in seven 
months. Stock prices, the dollar, and bond prices rose. Grain, soybean, wheat, and oat 
futures dropped. Gold prices fell sharply.</SUM>

State drought efforts include hauling water in Alabama, compiling a hay-source list in 
Georgia, committing $50 million to banks for lower-interest farm loans in Illinois, and  
seeking disaster status for North Dakota. UPS flew Oregon hay to Kentucky for free but 
logistical problems are delaying distribution. Ohio awaits hay from the South. Indiana 
farmers sued an insurance company reneging on drought insurance. Kansas City highway 
projects will open early because of few rain interruptions. Damages include lightning-
sparked Montana forest fires, shrinking Wisconsin cannery jobs, and reduced North 
Dakota spring wheat. Rain in Minnesota and Mississippi was less than needed. Hail 
damaged crops in South Dakota.</SUM>

Congress is writing legislation to provide up to $100,000 to farmers whose crops are 
wiped out by the drought, which Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng calls the largest in 
US history. President Reagan will visit drought-stricken areas tomorrow. UPS will ship 
20-30 tons of hay daily from Oregon to Kentucky for the next two weeks, to be stored at 
a fairground and sold to farmers chosen by lottery. Farmers are angered by the delay. 
Carolina and Virginia hay shipments, organized by the stock car world, will be trucked to 
Ohio tomorrow. Nevada has removed catch limits at reservoirs expected to dry up. Rain 
was widespread yesterday, and extremely heavy some places.</SUM>

Today's 1988 Drought Symposium, sponsored by The Weather Channel, was attended by 
13 state and national Weather experts. David Rodenhuis, director of the federal Climate 
Analysis Center in Washington, stressed the need to eliminate cause-and-effect 
possibilities and extend the range of analysis. Georgia state climatologist Gayther 
Plummer thought the drought in the SE was related to the position of Jupiter, but 
Rodenhuis remained skeptical. Hurricane specialist John Hope suggested the SE drought 
might be lessened or ended by a heavier than normal hurricane season. Some SE states 
get as much as 25% of their rainfall some months from hurricanes.</SUM>

The National Weather Service said yesterday that major grain-growing states had a 55-
60% chance of weather hotter and drier than normal over the next month. Southern and 
coastal California would also be dry. The Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest would be 
wetter than normal. The Agriculture Department forecast sharp crop declines. NOAA 
said dry spells have no normal lifetime, but statistical analysis of past droughts suggests 
many areas have less than a 4% chance of recovering in the next three months. At June's 
end, 29% of the continental US experienced severe drought. The current drought equals  
1911's, but is less severe than droughts in 1931, 1934, 1936, and 1956.</SUM>

Thirteen climatologists and meteorologists at The Weather Channel's Drought 
Symposium say added attention to climate has come from greenhouse effect worries and 
media centers falling in drought areas, but climate concern shouldn't end with the 
drought. Questions over whether global warming is short- or long-term and its impact 
means policymakers should deal with possible consequences and undertake sensible 
policies: reduce fossil fuel reliance, become more energy efficient, replant forests, and 
investigate alternative energy. Countries' characters could change as higher temperatures 
dry out the Midwest or melt polar ice caps. Climatologist Gayther Plummer suggests 
Jupiter passing the sun at its fastest point is related to SE drought in April and October.</SUM>

Drought has damaged Illinois River gamefish, killed 3,000 Minnesota turkeys, and 
increased Tennessee livestock sales. Logging at a Michigan forest may be banned.  
Georgia carpet mills may lay off workers. Ohio postponed cloud-seeding for lack of 
clouds. Alabama cotton remains endangered. Indiana and Missouri issued heat alerts. 
Chicago experienced five 100-degree days. Friday's thunderstorms brought Kansas 
tornadoes and Michigan hail. Lightning sparked a Montana forest fire. Railroads, like 
UPS, are offering free transport of hay to Kentucky. Southern hay reached Ohio. 
Minnesota dam flow reductions could affect Fargo's water supply. Wisconsin made $35 
million available for emergency farm loans. National Guardsmen provide an Iowa town's
