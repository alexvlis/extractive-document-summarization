Andrei Sakharov was a physicist who helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb. He later 
gained widespread fame as a human rights advocate and the 1979 winner of the Nobel 
Peace Prize.

His constant criticism irked the Kremlin. In 1980 he criticized the invasion of 
Afghanistan and Breznev exiled him to Gorky. Gorbachev freed him in 1986. Sakharov 
praised Gorbachev on foreign affairs, but criticized his economic policies. Sakharov was 
elected to the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies in April 1989.

Sakharov died suddenly on 14 December 1989. His obituary, signed by Gorbachev, was 
tantamount to  public apology.</SUM>
