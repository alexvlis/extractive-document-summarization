Andrei Sakharov, 68, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and a human rights activist, died in 
Moscow on 14 December 1989. 

Sakharov was a physicist who attained hero status for his work on the Soviet hydrogen 
bomb. He later made himself a nuisance to the Kremlin with his continual calls for 
improvement in the rights of the Soviet people. In 1973 the International League for 
Human Rights gave him an award, but he was not able to accept it until his first visit to 
New York City in 1989. His humanitarianism won him the 1975 Noble Peace Prize.
His gadfly activities throughout the 1970s exasperated the Kremlin. In January 1980, 
when he criticized the invasion of Afghanistan, President Brezhnev exiled him to the 
closed city of Gorky.

President Gorbachev freed Sakharov in December 1986. He and Yelena Bonner, his wile 
and fellow activist, settled in Moscow. He praised Gorbachev for the new direction in 
foreign affairs, but loudly criticized the slow pace of economic reform. In April 1989 
Sakharov was elected to membership in the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies.

Sakharov's obituary, signed by Gorbachev and published in Pravda, and the outpouring 
of remorse constituted a public apology for his exile.</SUM>
