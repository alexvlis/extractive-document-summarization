exercised her considerable power and seemed astonished when honors came her way.  
She always credited others for the success she achieved.  Miss Ball was late in reaching 
her comedy potential.  She was 40 when she starred in "I Love Lucy" which was to 
revolutionize television.  She rarely indulged in self-analysis, although she did say that 
she was ambivalent about the last 5 years of the show.  Her husband and costar Desi 
Arnaz was drinking and carousing and it was a terrible embarrassment for her.</SUM>
