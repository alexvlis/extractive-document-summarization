Virginia Thomas, the white wife of black Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, 
has represented the conservative viewpoint in the various positions she has held. 
Women's-rights activists dislike her opposition to comparable-worth legislation, religious 
groups are uncomfortable with her anti-cult activities, and some blacks feel the 
Thomases' marriage shows his rejection of the black community. Supporters reply that 
the Thomases believe women and minorities are hindered, not helped, by affirmative 
action and government programs and their marriage is a reflection of the couple's belief 
in a colorblind society. Clarence's Senate confirmation hearings began yesterday and 
are likely to run through next week.</SUM>

As Senate hearings on Clarence Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court continue, 
there appears to be no groundswell of opposition to his confirmation although 
Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have criticized the candidate's 
refusal to answer some questions and his reply when asked his view on abortion: 
"Whether or not I have a view is irrelevant." The committee's 14 members seem to 
break down into three groups: 5 Republicans solidly for Thomas; 6 Democrats in 
opposition; and three swing votes, one Republican and two Democrats. Thomas is 
expected to continue testifying through Friday and the committee will hear from other 
witnesses next week.</SUM>

Frustrated Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee complain that Supreme Court 
nominee Clarence Thomas is an evasive witness, but there has been no groundswell of 
opposition to his confirmation. Several Senators were skeptical of Thomas's insistence 
that he has no opinion on the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. 
Senators criticized Thomas's tendency to back away from comments made in past 
speeches or articles giving, as one put it, the "appearance of a confirmation 
conversion." 5 of the 14 committee members, all Republicans, appear solidly for 
Thomas, probably 6 Democrats are opposed, and three swing votes, one Republican, 
two Democrats, could go either way.</SUM>

On Monday Clarence Thomas completed five days of questioning by the Senate 
Judiciary Committees and appeared to be well on his way to confirmation. Speculation 
is that the committee will recommend confirmation by a 10-4 or 9-5 vote. Several liberal 
Democrats accused Thomas of being evasive and of disavowing controversial 
statements he had made as an advocate of the Bush and Reagan administrations. The 
American Bar Association evaluation committee testified that although Thomas'
articles in law journals were deficient in presentation, scholarship and analysis, this is 
outweighed by his "brief but highly satisfactory performance on the Court of Appeals."</SUM>

Virginia Thomas, the white wife of black Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, is 
a brainy lawyer with an impressive career. Critics see her as a woman with strong 
opinions on issues that are bound to come before the court. Women's-rights activists 
cite her opposition to comparable-worth legislation and some religious groups dislike 
her anti-cult activities. Some blacks feel the Thomases' marriage shows his rejection of 
the black community. But in the eyes of the Thomases they have stood for true equality 
and rejected programs that actually harm women and minorities by lowering standards. 
They advocate and live their belief in a colorblind society.</SUM>

Senators are under pressure to take a stand on  Supreme Court nominee Clarence 
Thomas. 300 black pastors of the Coalition for the Restoration of the Black Family and 
Society held a pro-Thomas rally on the steps of the Supreme Court. The Citizens 
Committee to Confirm Clarence Thomas ran a television ad in four southern states 
where senators face re-election next year. On the other side, senators are receiving the 
first of 500,000 anti-Thomas postcards provided by the National Abortion Rights Action 
League and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law announced that 86 of 
about 110 members of its board of directors oppose Thomas.</SUM>
