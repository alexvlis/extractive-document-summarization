The US had its worst Winter Olympic showing in 52 years the 1988 Games.  The
only gold medal winners were Brian Boitano in figure skating and Bonnie
Blair in speed skating.  Debi Thomas, the US hope in figure skating had to
settle for a bronze after East Germany's Katarina Witt took gold and
Canadian Elizabeth Manley the silver.  The Seoul Summer Games were a much
brighter arena for the US with multiple gold medal winners, but the Soviets
were the overall winners.  Drug usage disqualified several athletes, most
notably Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson.  Because the US showing did not equal
their domination in the Los Angeles Games four years earlier (boycotted by
the Soviets) and because of unimaginative TV coverage, lucrative endorsement
contracts did not appear to be forthcoming for the winners.

The late Jesse Owens, hero of the 1936 Berlin Games was honored with a
Congressional Gold Medal, which was given to his widow by President Bush.

Teams from affluent nations usually dominate Olympic relay events, and that
was expected to happen in Barcelona in 1992.  The US has an imposing group
of runners in those events.

In non-Olympic years, World Cup and World University Games featured many
successful Olympic athletes.</SUM>
