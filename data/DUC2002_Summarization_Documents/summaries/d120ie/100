At 47, John Major became Britain's youngest prime minister. His accession to power 
followed the surprise resignation of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher following a 
challenge by former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine to her leadership. Major fell two 
votes shy of a victory in an election with Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and Heseltine 
but both opponents quickly conceded to Major. Since his election, Major has been seen as 
weak and indecisive. He is an unpopular leader whose cabinet has been rocked by 
scandal and who reneged on campaign promises. Adding to his unpopularity is the 
recession which continues plague Britain.</SUM>
