John Major was 47 when he was elected to lead the Conservative Party. Assuming the 
position of prime Minister from Margaret, Mr. Major became the youngest prime 
minister since the 19th century. Mr. Major was confirmed as leader of the Conservative 
Party when his two opponents, former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine and Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd, conceded defeat in an election which saw Major two votes shy 
of a majority. Major, whose father was a trapeze artist in the circus, overcame many 
obstacles in his rise to the top. He was a high school drop out and for a time was a 
welfare recipient. Mr. Major had little time to enjoy his victory as public opinion of him 
soon soured. While seen as gentler than his abrasive predecessor, he is viewed as timid 
and indecisive. Almost from the first he has been beset by scandal in his cabinet and a 
number of controversies ranging from internal party differences over Europe to the 
debacle surrounding Britain's withdrawal from the exchange rates mechanism of the 
European Monetary System to a deep and continuing recession. Major came out in strong 
support of U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf, calling on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to 
withdraw his troops from Kuwait.</SUM>
