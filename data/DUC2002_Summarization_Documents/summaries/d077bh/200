An earthquake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale rocked Northern California at 5:04pm 
on October 17, 1989. Felt 225 miles away, it lasted 15 seconds, caused $2 billion 
damage, and killed 60. Candlestick Park shook and World Series Game Three was 
postponed. Buildings collapsed because of poor soil and structural design. Chinatown on 
firm hills and Telegraph, Nob, and Russian Hills on rock escaped major damage. The 
Marina District, on landfill dredged from the bay, lost 60 buildings and was swept by fire. 
Apartment buildings with garages across the bottom were most vulnerable. High-rises 
built to strict earthquake codes swayed with little damage. Part of the Bay Bridge's upper 
deck collapsed. The 1906 San Francisco quake, estimated at 8.3, killed 2500. Debate 
waged over whether northern or southern California was due for the next big quake. A 
1988 report targeted Tuesday's epicenter, 75 miles south in the Santa Cruz area, as 
Northern California's most likely spot, with 30% probability of a 6.5 quake within 30 
years. Los Angeles, Los Alamos, Israel, and France offered survivor-search help. British 
engineers assessed structural damage. Other help came from relief organizations, 
companies, cities, and the federal government. Charleston, SC, suffering similar yet 
different damage and disruption from Hurricane Hugo, sent water and sympathy.</SUM>
