A major earthquake, lasting 15 seconds and measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale, rocked 
northern California Tuesday evening. Candlestick Park, where fans awaited start of the 
World Series, shook and was evacuated. San Francisco buildings swayed several feet and 
some collapsed. A 30-foot section of the San Francisco Bay Bridge upper deck collapsed 
onto the bottom level.  The quake shook buildings 95 miles northeast in Sacramento, and 
was felt 225 miles east in Reno, Nevada. It knocked out phones and power. The Richter 
scale measures ground motion. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in 
magnitude. The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 has been estimated at 8.3.</SUM>

An earthquake measuring 6.9 rocked Northern California at 5:04pm Tuesday. 
Candlestick Park swayed and shook. World Series Game Three was canceled and fans 
evacuated. Fires raged in San Francisco's Marina District and near the UC Berkeley 
library. A 30-foot section of the San Francisco Bay Bridge collapsed, killing one and 
leaving two cars dangling between levels. Buildings and statues in the South of Market 
district collapsed. The airport was evacuated and BART shut down. The quake centered 
75 miles south in the Santa Cruz area. In nearby Hollister, a building and bridge 
collapsed. The smell of gas pervaded Marin. Buildings 200 miles away shook.  President 
Bush promised federal help.</SUM>

Seismologists had targeted the area struck by Tuesday's earthquake as the most likely 
spot in Northern California for a strong quake, with 30% probability of a 6.5 quake by the 
year 2018. The central California town of Parkfield has a 90% probability, the state's 
highest. Probability calculation includes length of time since the last major quake. 
Tuesday's 6.9 quake was centered in the Santa Cruz area, 75 miles south of San 
Francisco. The widespread damage especially affected highways and old masonry 
buildings that have the same type of structure as those heavily damaged in the 1987 
Whittier quake in the Los Angeles area, which measured 5.9.</SUM>

Tuesday's 6.9 earthquake was probably a strike-slip quake with one fault side grinding 
horizontally past another. The fracture was 10 miles deep and stretched 30 miles south 
from the epicenter, which was the southernmost point of maximum ground slippage in 
1906 and earlier identified as 30% likely for a major jolt in the next 30 years. Scientists 
are concerned at the increase of recent 5-magnitude quakes, similar to those preceding the 
1906 quake. Some of nearby San Jose's recent Calaveras fault quakes may have added 
pressure on the San Andreas fault, California's longest and most deadly.  Damages 
include building and highway collapses, Marina district fires, and deaths.</SUM>

A reporter at Candlestick Park Tuesday night when the earthquake hit first thought a low-
flying jet had passed overhead. The stadium shook and the special concrete joints 
strategically spaced around the top of the stadium to prevent earthquake damage did what 
they were designed to, opening and closing as if the stadium was cardboard instead of 
concrete. There was no great alarm or panic because the quake didn't last long. Those on 
upper levels seemed more shaken than those on lower. A few people ran out of the 
stadium, but most waited in their seats to hear if Game Three of the World Series would 
be postponed.</SUM>

A great quake hit southern California in 1857 and an 8.3 quake hit San Francisco in 1906, 
killing 2500. The same size quake takes longer to happen again because quakes relieve  
stress, so scientists believed the next big one would strike the LA area. In 1985 Geologist 
Christopher Scholz predicted a 6.9 quake any time in a northern portion of the San 
Andreas Fault, believing the 1906 quake relieved less stress than thought. A 1988 US 
Geological Survey report predicted a 20% likelihood of a 7 quake there within 30 years, 
and a 30% chance of a 6.5 quake in the area where Tuesday's 6.9 quake was centered.</SUM>

The California Seismic Safety Commission is just now figuring out bits and pieces of the 
Bay Area earthquake disaster, feeling like the blind man trying to feel an elephant. A 
schoolteacher in Silicon Valley's Sunnyvale described the earthquake as going on and on, 
refusing to pass like most do. A woman driving south toward San Francisco first thought 
smoke from the Marina district fire was fog, then saw a big ball of flame. At Candlestick 
Park, a reporter covering the World Series for a New York radio station reported seeing 
the upper deck shaking and light stanchions blowing back and forth.</SUM>

Offers of equipment and personnel for San Francisco Bay earthquake survivor searches  
came from Los Angeles, Los Alamos, Israel, and France. LA shipped doctors, police, and 
fire investigators. British engineers came to assess structural damage. Charleston sent  
drinking water, symbolic of support following Hugo. The Salvation Army dispatched 12 
mobile canteens. The Red Cross, strained by Hurricane Hugo, opened 25 shelters. Its  
LA, San Diego and Portland offices sent blood. Osaka, Japan promised $10,000. 
Anheuser-Busch sent canned water. The Coast Guard sent boats and helicopters. The IRS

In San Francisco's 6.9 earthquake, buildings collapsed because of poor soil and structural 
design. Chinatown's unreinforced masonry was thought vulnerable but survived because 
of Chinatown's firm soil. Telegraph, Nob, and Russian Hills, built on rock, escaped 
damage. The Marina District, which lost 60 buildings, is built on landfill dredged from 
the bay. Most vulnerable were four-story apartment buildings with garages across the 
bottom, which pitched forward. High-rises swayed with little damage because of 
earthquake codes that demand construction to withstand an 8-magnitude quake with a 
San Francisco epicenter. Earth and wind forces aren't considered as much with smaller 
buildings.  Elsewhere, Victorian homes shifted off foundations and chimneys crumbled.</SUM>

Charleston and San Francisco are united by suffering two of the century's costliest, back-
to-back natural disasters, Hurricane Hugo and the Bay Area earthquake. Both endured 
disruption of normal life, destroyed buildings, billions in damages, loss of life, and 
frustrating delays in getting federal assistance. The two disasters were different because 
Hugo gave Charleston warning. Its damage was everywhere, over quickly, and 
immediately evident, whereas earthquakes leave hidden damage and have aftershocks. 
Charleston recovered slowly and disrupted communications left it isolated. San 
Francisco's earthquake was reported immediately and the city bounced back quickly. 
Charleston lost no major lifeline like the Bay Bridge.</SUM>
