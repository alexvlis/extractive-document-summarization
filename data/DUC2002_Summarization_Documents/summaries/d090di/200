Philippine President Corazon Aquino's administration was beset with problems from 
June 1988 to October 1990.  Her predecessor, Ferdinand Marcos was exiled to Hawaii, 
but had allies in the Philippines and continued to create dissension.  Swiss bankers 
required a criminal prosecution to release information on the $10 billion he allegedly 
stole and deposited in Switzerland.  After he became terminally ill, his wife, Imelda, and 
his supporters wanted him to be allowed to die, or at least be buried, in his homeland.  
Aquino refused all requests citing security reasons.  From a landlord family, Aquino's 
agrarian reform policy suffered a number of setbacks.  Economic problems were the 
focus of her 1989 European trip, where she touted improvements in the growth rate under 
her leadership and sought debt relief and foreign investments.  The Philippine military 
created a continuing problem, leading coups and mutinies.  The December 1989 
attempted coup divided Filipinos in Los Angeles and involved Aquino asking for help 
from United States forces stationed there.  Criticized for past indecisive actions, Aquino 
quickly ended the October 1990 coup attempt on Mindanao.  Communist insurgents 
continued their 21-year campaign.  In April 1990, she said she was willing to negotiate 
with the insurgents and renegade military.</SUM>
