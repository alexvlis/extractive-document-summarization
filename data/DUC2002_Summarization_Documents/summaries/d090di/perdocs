Philippine President Corazon Aquino has agreed to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return so 
that he can be prosecuted for stealing billions of dollars.  Manila newspapers reported 
today, that she told this to lawyers in Switzerland when she visited there.  She has refused 
to allow Marcos, in exile in Hawaii, back into the Philippines, citing security reasons.  He 
was ousted in a 1986 coup and is accused of stealing $10 billion, much of it allegedly 
deposited in Swiss bank accounts.  Although the Swiss government has frozen these 
funds, Swiss law allows secrecy requirements to be lifted only for a criminal prosecution.</SUM>

President Corazon Aquino said today she will not allow ousted leader Ferdinand Marcos 
to return home to die or allow his body to be buried in the Philippines.  Marcos is in 
critical condition in a Honolulu hospital suffering from renal, cardiac, and pulmonary 
failure.  His wife, Imelda, and his lawyer are appealing for his return.  Imelda's 
spokesman has said she is trying to reach Aquino, but this is denied by Aquino's 
daughter.  Aquino's national security advisor says Marcos' return is still an option, but, 
although he is no longer a threat, his followers could cause disruptions.</SUM>

Friday, President Corazon Aquino refused to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return to the 
Philippines to die or permit his body to be buried here.  Marcos is in critical condition in 
Honolulu.  His wife, Imelda, broadcast an appeal to allow his return and said she was 
trying to contact the president.  The president's daughter denied receiving any calls.  
Aquino, whose government has survived six coup attempts, cited security reasons, but 
said she was praying for Marcos' recovery.  Marcos' supporters are planning a rally for 
Saturday and warned of demonstrations if he should die in exile.  The Philippine military 
said law and order will prevail.</SUM>

Marcos to be buried in the Philippines.  He is near death in Hawaii, where he has been in

Marco is accused of looting the nation's treasury and is under U.S. indictment, he still has 
supporters in the Philippines.  They are accused of at least three coup attempts and now

Philippine President Corazon Aquino is in West Germany today seeking expanded 
economic ties.  She compared the Philippines' economic situation with that of Germany 
following World War II and asked Germany to share its experiences.  She projected the 
debt to increase to $29 billion by December.  She said the nation's growth rate changed 
from minus 10 percent in 1985 to plus 6.7 percent in 1988.  Debt relief and investments 
are her goal.  German leaders promised strengthened relations and continuing trade in the 
future European Economic Community market.  Aquino is on the first stop of a European 
tour to include Paris and Belgium.</SUM>

Filipinos clashed Thursday at the consulate in Los Angles over the military coup 
underway in their homeland.  One group, in sympathy with the coup leader Lt. Col 
Gregorio Honasan, held a candlelight vigil outside, then several people entered the 
consulate and confronted the acting consul general.  They decried government corruption 
and incompetence and demanded President Corazon Aquino resign.  Aquino supporters, 
who had just completed a news conference, loudly defended the government and its 
institutions and began chanting "Cory!"  Their leader said he believes most of the 
350,000 Filipinos in Los Angles County oppose the coup and called the military 
dangerous.</SUM>

Philippines Vice President and opposition leader Salvador H. Laurel, in Hong Kong on 
Saturday, refused to condemn the armed insurrection underway in his country.  He 
predicted the fighting could turn to civil war if reinforcements arrive from outer islands.  
Laurel, head of the Nacionalista Party, broke with Aquino shortly after they took office 
and has continued to criticize her.  He panned Aquino's request for U.S. help on Friday.  
U.S. officials said jets flew over rebel aircraft to keep them on the ground, but did not 
fire.  Laurel says U.S. aircraft damaged facilities and killed civilians near the armed 
forces headquarters.</SUM>

Florencio Abad, the Philippines land reform secretary-designate, resigned on Thursday, 
undermining President Corazon Aquino's commitment to agrarian reform, once the 
centerpiece of her administration, and highlighting administration problems.  Abad's 
problems began in January when he tried to stop the leasing of land, which he thought 
should be distributed to peasants, to a Japanese corporation.  A compromise was reached, 
but landowners in Congress were alarmed and blocked Abad's confirmation.  Many 
question Aquino's true stance on agrarian reform.  She is from a landlord family, heavily 
influenced by her brother, and had turned land reform details over to Congress, which 
loaded the program with loopholes.</SUM>

Philippine President Corazon Aquino said today she is willing to negotiate a ceasefire 
with Communist guerrillas and former soldiers, reversing a long held policy.  The 
government blames almost daily explosions in Manila on the former soldiers and the 
Communists have been waging a 21-year rebellion.  Aquino rejected a call for 
negotiations in July, but accepted urging on Tuesday by a pro-Aquino senator to begin 
discussions.  Juan Ponce Enrile, implicated in a 1986 coup attempt, said he is willing to 
reconcile.  The last ceasefire with the Communists collapsed in early 1987.  Defense 
Secretary Fidel Ramos, who is credited with crushing six coup attempts, has refused any 
talks.</SUM>

Philippine President Corazon Aquino quickly responded to the most recent coup attempt.  
She used small bombers and artillery to end the bizarre rebellion led by army Col. 
Alexander Nobel.  From October 4 to 6, Nobel led 350 rebels along the coast of 
Mindanao and seized two military camps.  He then joined with the head of the Mindanao 
Independence Movement.  Aquino's reactions to two major coup attempts and six 
military mutinies had been indecisive.  This time she surprised the rebels.  Noble's 
uprising coincided with the release of a fact-finding report on last December's coup, 
which estimated scores of involved officers are still at large and plotting.</SUM>
