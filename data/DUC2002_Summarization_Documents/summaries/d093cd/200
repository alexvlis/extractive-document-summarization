Overloading is a major contributor to ferry and passenger boat accidents, particularly in 
the third world.  Ferries in India, Guatemala, Egypt, China and Bangladesh all carried far 
more passengers than authorized when they sank.  Captain error also contributed to 
accidents.  In Guatemala, a ferry captain was charges with negligent homicide when his 
boat which was being towed, sank after he failed to steer it.   A ferry sank off the 
Egyptian coast after inexplicably leaving standard navigational channels and ramming a 
coral reef in stormy seas.  In that accident, survivors claimed that crewmembers 
abandoned ship without helping them.  The ship's engineer denied the charges.  Two 
boats carrying Somali refugees sank off the coast of Kenya, resulting in more than 140 
deaths, although the cause of the sinking was not reported. An overcrowded ferry in 
Bangladesh sank with almost double the passengers it was authorized.  In a separate ferry 
incident in Bangladesh, pirates robbed passengers and threw six overboard. In the Indian 
accident, monsoon rains may have contributed as well as overcrowding.  Even an 
advanced country such as Israel can experience ferry accidents.  Nineteen U.S. sailors 
died when an Israeli ferry sank while returning the sailors to the USS Saratoga.  No cause 
was reported.</SUM>
