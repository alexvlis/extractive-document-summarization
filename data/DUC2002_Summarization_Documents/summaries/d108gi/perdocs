Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait and by early Friday controlled Kuwait city, the capital.  
Soldiers also were sweeping through the oilfields.  More than 200 Kuwaiti casualties are 
reported.  The Sheik fled to Saudi Arabia.  Iraq, with 17 million people, amassed 100,000 
of the most battle-trained army in the Arab world on the border.  Kuwait has 1.9 million 
residents, 60 percent foreigners, and an army of 20,300.  Iraq accused Kuwait of stealing 
and overproducing oil.  The U.N. Security Council, the Soviets, and President Bush have 
condemned the attack.  A U.S. naval group is moving toward the area, as oil prices soar.</SUM>

Iraqi's powerful army claimed victory today in its lightning invasion of oil-rich Kuwait.  
The Kuwaiti emir has fled to Saudi Arabia and Iraqis occupy the palace and all 
government buildings and are moving toward the oil facilities.  More that 200 Kuwaitis 
were killed or wounded, including the emir's brother.  Iraq claims it invaded at the request 
of revolutionaries who staged a coup and would withdraw soon.  Relations between the 
two countries had been tense, before 100,000 Iraqi troops moved to the border.  The emir's 
family has ruled Kuwait for almost 250 years.  Kuwait's borders and airport are closed.</SUM>

Perspectives on the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait differ.  Iraq' deputy permanent 
representative to the U.N. claims "the Iraqi government...is pursuing no goal or objective 
and wishes only cordial relations with Kuwait."  He also said Iraq "will withdraw as soon 
as order has been restored."  Kuwait's ambassador to the U.N. declared that the invasion 
took place on a false, flimsy pretext, and if it is not "deterred in a decisive manner" by the 
U.N., no country will ever be safe.  President Bush said, "We remain committed to take 
whatever actions are necessary to defend our longstanding, vital interests in the Gulf."</SUM>

The dispute between Iraq and Kuwait began when Iraq accused Kuwait of flooding the oil 
market and stealing $2.4 billion worth of oil.  On July 20, Kuwaiti officials responded that 
Iraq wanted them to forgive war debts.  On July 24, the United States announced a "short-
notice exercise" in the Persian Gulf and Kuwait went on alert.  Saddam Hussein then 
summoned the U.S. ambassador for talks.  OPEC ministers then agreed to halt 
overproduction and the two nations met to negotiate, although 100,000 Iraqi troops were 
on the border.  Talks collapsed the next day and Iraq invaded at 2 a.m. on August 2.</SUM>

Iraq struck back against the West today, rounding up foreign nationals in Kuwait as the 
U.N. Security Council approved trade and military sanctions.  More than one million 
foreigners live and work in Kuwait.  Several hundred Americans and Europeans were 
grabbed, with some taken to Iraq, and passengers on a British Airways flight were 
detained.  Sanctions include a ban on purchases of Iraqi oil.  Prices have soared and Iraq 
sales have dropped.  Sources report Saudi troops moving toward its border with Kuwait.  
Iraq has ordered air raid drills and warned of U.S. or Israeli attacks.  Bush has said all 
options are open.</SUM>

An Iraqi airways jet arrived today in Amman, Jordan, carrying 78 foreigners.  This is the 
first commercial flight out of Iraq since it invaded Kuwait and the U.N. Security Council 
banned all trade and military ties with Iraq.  Thousands of Westerns have been stranded, 
including passengers of a British Airways flight.  Many of those passengers, including 28 
Americans, are in Baghdad hotels.  About 1,000 people a day are reported fleeing Kuwait 
through the desert to Saudi Arabia.  Iraq has closed its borders with Jordan, which has been 
asked to facilitate the exit of American diplomats and their families from Baghdad.</SUM>

Iranian editorial writers are rejoicing that the rest of the world is waking up to one of their 
most hated bogeymen--Saddam Hussein.  Saddam attacked Iran in September 1980 and the 
war dragged on until August 1988.  For the last six months, editorial writers have backed 
off Saddam because of U.N. sponsored bilateral talks.  The invasion of Kuwait changed 
this.  The writers now are castigating Kuwait and the United States--the Great Satan--for 
creating a Frankenstein by supporting Iraq in the war.  Some Iranian pundits believe this 
will be an excuse for the United States to reenter the Persian Gulf.</SUM>

Invading Iraqis are trying to appear as Kuwaitis according to charges from the Kuwaiti 
ambassador to the United States, Sheik Saud al Nasir al Sabah.  He claims to have 
information that the Kuwaitis are being allowed to leave to be replaced by Iraqis, who are 
commandeering their homes and even their clothes. He accused Iraq of trucking people in 
and issuing them new identity cards.  Kuwaiti officials who refuse to cooperated are being 
executed or bused to Baghdad for further interrogations.  Refugees report that almost all 
government buildings and palaces have been destroyed, with only the water systems and 
oil equipment spared.</SUM>

Most countries have joined a U.N.-sanctioned boycott of oil from Iraq and Kuwait in an 
effort to convince Iraq to withdraw its forces.  Turkey shut off the two Iraqi pipes that 
cross that country, and the flow is reduced through the only other major export pipeline.  
The European Economic Community, the Scandinavian countries, and even neutral 
Switzerland are strongly supporting the trade bans.  Little Cyprus will lose 70 percent of its 
petroleum.  Japan is supportive, but China has been low key.  Oil prices are at a five year 
high and will go even higher.  France will impose price controls on Thursday.</SUM>
