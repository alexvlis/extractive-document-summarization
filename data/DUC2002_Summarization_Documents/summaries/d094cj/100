Japan's Emperor Hirohito, posthumously named Showa, left a $13 million
taxable estate.  He died of cancer on Jan. 7.

Hirohito is remembered for surrendering in WW II. Though many world
leaders mourned his passing, South Korea and others viewed him as a
symbol of Japanese crimes against Asian people.

Generally portrayed as a peaceful man, a January BBC documentary
claims that Truman decided not to prosecute Hirohito for war crimes,
and that Japan's wartime prime minister was pressured into changing
his testimony to avoid incriminating the emperor.  An LA newspaper
published a letter to the editor after Hirohito's death also
questioning his innocence.</SUM>
