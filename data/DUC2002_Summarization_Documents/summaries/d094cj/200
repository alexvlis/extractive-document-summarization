Emperor Hirohito, who died on January 7 of cancer after several months of internal 
bleeding, left a taxable estate of approximately $13 million. 

Posthumously named Showa, or Enlightened Peace, the name of his reign, Hirohito will 
be remembered for his most courageous decision in his 62-year reign: Japan must 
surrender and end the Pacific conflict in WW II.

Though many world leaders mourned his death, painful WW II memories sparked 
criticism of the monarch. South Korea sent condolences, but a government party 
statement added, "We reserve further comment, considering the unhappy past." 
A Taiwanese newspaper noted that "while Hirohito apologized to the United States and 
Europe...", he did not direct a single word to China..." 

Generally portrayed as having had no significant role in the war, a BBC documentary by 
Edward Behr challenged this view, alleging that Hirohito had advance knowledge of the 
Pearl Harbor attack. The show also claims that President Truman decided not to 
prosecute Hirohito for war crimes, and Japan's wartime prime minister, Gen.Tojo, was 
pressured into changing his testimony to avoid incriminating the emperor. A letter to the 
editor of an LA newspaper after Hirohito's death also expressed doubt that he was 
blameless.</SUM>
