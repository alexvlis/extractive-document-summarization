Over several hours on Thursday Emperor Hirohito's blood pressure fell from 132 over 60 
to 112 over 50 and his pulse dropped from 104 per minute to 84, according to Imperial 
Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda. Maeda said the emperor's blood pressure 
has returned to its normal level, but that the intestinal hemorrhaging that began a month 
ago resumed Thursday and the pace of the discharges was quickening. 

Hirohito, 87, has been bedridden for a month. He has received nearly 22 pints of blood 
since his illness worsened Sept. 19. A palace source said he gets 600-700 calories a day, 
intravenously.</SUM>

Emperor Hirohito's condition weakened Friday, but doctors speculated that a scab had 
stopped internal bleeding, said Imperial Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda. 
Hirohito has suffered repeated bouts of bleeding but has not discharged blood in nine 
days. 

News reports quoted Maeda as saying Hirohito, 87, normally weighs104 pounds, but now 
weighs only 66 pounds.

Since Sept. 19, when he was confined to intensive care after vomiting blood, Hirohito has 
received 42 pints of blood.

Palace officials have not given details on Hirohito's illness and they would not comment 
on Japanese news reports that the emperor has pancreatic cancer.</SUM>

Emperor Hirohito, 87, will be remembered for his first effective and the most courageous 
decision during his 62-year reign: Japan must surrender and end the Pacific conflict in 
WW II. He is generally portrayed as having played no significant role in Japan's war 
efforts. 

In the first 20 years of his reign, Hirohito was worshipped as a divinity. On January 1, 
1945 he publicly renounced his divinity, enabling him to remain as the symbolic head of 
Japan and assuring that he would not face charges as a war criminal. In post-WW II 
Japan, he was often viewed as a kind uncle.</SUM>

United States, New Zealand, Filipino, and Australian leaders mourned Emperor Hirohito, 
dead today at 87, but reaction in South Korea and Taiwan was cool. 

The South Korean President sent his condolences, but a government party statement 
added, "We reserve further comment..." Japan forcibly annexed the peninsula in 1910 
and ruled until the end of WW II.

Taiwan does not enjoy diplomatic relations with Japan, therefore, there was no official 
Taiwanese statement, but the Chinese daily United Evening News said, "Now Hirohito 
has died. We may not want to collect the reparations, but we shall never forget the painful 
historic lessons."</SUM>

Though many world leaders mourned the death of Emperor Hirohito on Saturday, painful 
WW II memories still generated criticism of the Japanese monarch.

South Korea sent condolences, but a government party statement added, "We reserve 
further comment, considering the unhappy past."

Taiwan will be represented at the funeral, but a Taiwanese newspaper said, "While 
Hirohito apologized to the United States and Europe, he did not direct a single word to 
China to show his sorrow."

The Netherlands sent sympathy without mentioning the name "Hirohito" in its message. 
Over 20,000 people died under Japan's wartime occupation of the former Dutch East 
Indies.</SUM>

Biographer Edward Behr released information Wednesday about his BBC documentary 
on Hirohito. President Truman, the show claims, decided not to prosecute Hirohito for 
war crimes, and Japan's wartime prime minister, Gen. Tojo, was pressured into changing 
his testimony so the emperor would not be incriminated. The show also challenges the 
theory that Hirohito was forced to accept his generals' plans, alleging that he knew about 
the 1937 massacre of over 20,000 Chinese at Nanking and had advance knowledge of the 
Pearl Harbor attack.

BBC will show the documentary on Jan 24. It will air in the United States in March.</SUM>

In a letter to the editor published Sunday Steve Hu wrote, "...before the war he [Hirohito] 
was regarded as god and was worshipped in Japan with religious vigor. At the surrender 
of the Imperial Japanese government, Hirohito was spared punishment because it was 
his ambitious military generals who made the decision to invade the neighbors. I found it 
is very hard to believe that a man in his middle age, in his position, in his culture and in 
his country at that time had nothing much to do with all the military aggravations that his 
armies imposed on neighboring countries."</SUM>

In Japan, Emperor Hirohito was simply called Tenno Heika, meaning His Majesty The 
Emperor.

After his death he was posthumously named Showa, the name he chose for his reign soon 
after he became emperor in 1926. It means Enlightened Peace, and has been succeeded 
by Heisei, or Achieving Peace, the name the government chose for the reign of Hirohito's 
son Akihito a few hours after the emperor died on Jan. 7.

In Japan, years are numbered according to the emperor's tenure on the throne. Thus, 1926 
was Showa 1 and 1989 was Showa 64 until Hirohito's death. Now this year is Heisei 1.</SUM>

Emperor Hirohito left $13.06 million in taxable property the Kojimachi Tax Office near 
the Imperial Palace announced Monday. I t was the first time that tax authorities have 
disclosed the amount of an emperor's taxable estate, an official said. Until the end of 
WW II, emperors were regarded as living gods.

Hirohito died of cancer on Jan. 7 at age 87. He was succeeded by Akihito, his eldest son. 

Three sacred treasures--a mirror, sword and jewels--which were transferred from 
emperor to emperor, were tax-exempt, as were 3,180 items of art owned by Hirohito that 
were donated to the state.</SUM>
