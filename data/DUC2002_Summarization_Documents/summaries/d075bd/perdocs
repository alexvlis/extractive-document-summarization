A natural substance called transforming growth factor (TGF) beta appears to be able to 
limit damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack.  A study at the Jefferson Medical 
College in Philadelphia showed that laboratory rats induced to have heart attacks, 
suffered 50 percent less cell damage after injections of TGF beta than rats that did not 
receive TGF beta.  The TGF beta seems to block the action of other substances, such as 
tumor necrosis factor, that can cause blood vessels to narrow following a heart attack. 
Any experimental treatment of human heart attack victims with TGF beta is at least a 
year away.</SUM>

An operation to lower the cholesterol levels of heart attack patients reduced their risk of 
another heart attack or death from heart disease.  In the operation, called ileal bypass, one 
third of the small intestine is bypassed.  This reduces the amount of cholesterol absorbed 
into the bloodstream. The operation has one significant drawback, it causes chronic 
diarrhea that persists for years.  Despite wide acceptance of cholesterol drugs, doubts 
remained about whether lower cholesterol actually helped people to live longer.  This 
offers the strongest justification for marked cholesterol lowering that has ever been 
offered, according to one researcher.</SUM>

A large study has shown that taking a single aspirin every other day could cut heart attack 
risk in half.  This was one of several reports that show doctors can prevent heart attacks 
as well as treat them.  Doctor's also found that one aspirin and a single dose of clot 
dissolving given within 24 hours of heart attack dramatically cut the risk of a second fatal 
heart attack.

Other researchers determined that some heart attack victims could be released from the 
hospital as soon as three days after their heart attacks. After 6 months, not one death was 
reported in the early discharge group.</SUM>

A drug that eases the heart's workload can cut the risk of new cardiac attacks and death 
by 20 percent in people recovering from heart attacks.  The drug, Verapanil, a calcium 
channel blocker is about as effective as another variety of blood pressure medicines 
known as beta blockers at protecting people after heart attacks.  Since beta-blockers are 
generally not recommended for people with emphysema and asthma, it is important to 
have alternatives.  Next, researchers plan to study clot-dissolving drugs to see what effect 
they have on unstable angina, a condition in which people suffer spontaneous chest pain.</SUM>

An experiment with more than 1700 high blood pressure patients showed that a blood and 
urine test can pinpoint those patients most likely to have a heart attack.  The tests, which 
measure the activity of a blood protein called renin, may also suggest a new risk factor 
for heart attacks.  The study was conducted on people found to have mild to moderately 
high blood pressure.  Only 12% of these people had high renin "profiles".   But 7 heart 
attacks in this small group constituted the highest incidents of heart attacks.  The study 
has implications for drug makers as well as patients.</SUM>

Deaths from heart and blood vessel disease dropped 24% over the past decade. But it 
remains by far the nation's largest killer.  Experts attribute the decline to a combination 
of healthier living habits, including fewer cigarettes, better food and improved medical 
treatment.  Statistics show that more than one in four Americans suffer from some form 
of cardiovascular disease and half of these will eventually die from it.  Since 60% of 
heart attacks occur before the victim reaches the hospital, a major goal is getting people 
to go to the hospital at the first sign of a heart attack.</SUM>

New treatments that stop a heart attack in its tracks, may help victims leave the hospital 
as early as three days after their attacks.  Early discharges were made possible by two 
medical advances, tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) and angioplasty.  TPA can 
dissolve clots in the heart's arteries and minimize damage and angioplasty can clear 
arteries by opening them with tiny balloons.  Hospital stays have been steadily shortening 
over the past decades as doctors learned that prolonged inactivity caused patients to 
develop blood clots and become demoralized.  If 15% of heart attack patients were 
discharges after three days, the annual savings would be $280 million.</SUM>

A study found that if heart attack victims quickly receive clot-dissolving drugs, they 
usually don't need the extra step of a common balloon procedure, known as angioplasty. 
The clot-dissolving factor known as TPA, dramatically improved the survival chances of 
heart attack victims.  When groups who underwent angioplasty were compared to groups 
who received TPA and only those with lingering heart pain or other symptoms underwent 
angioplasty, there was no difference in survival rates.  The results mean that most patients 
can be treated in community hospitals where angioplasty is not available and that the 
nation could save $704 million in medical bills.</SUM>

Doctors should be cautious in prescribing aspirin to prevent heart attacks until more 
research supports its value. Studies do indicate that aspirin reduces the risk of first non-
fatal heart attacks, by reducing the ability of blood platelets to form clots.  But for people 
who have clotting problems or have high blood pressure aspirin may increase the risk for 
hemorrhagic stroke.  In one study, there were 10 hemorrhagic strokes recorded among the 
11,000 subjects taking aspirin, compared with 2 strokes in the 11,000 taking a substitute.  
Overall death rates for the two groups were similar, though the aspirin non-fatal heart 
attack rate was much lower.</SUM>

A drug, diltiazen, used to treat patients complaining of chest pain could help prevent 
heart attacks in four out five patients.  But, diltiazen increases the subsequent heart attack 
in patients whose hearts pump abnormally.  Study results suggest the drug may be 
effective in decreasing the likelihood of a second heart attack in the majority of patients.
But patients with pulmonary congestion given diltiazen, increase their chances of a 
subsequent heart attack.  Diliazen, a calcium entry blocker, is one of a new class of drugs 
in the fight against heart disease.  Nitrates and beta-blockers are the other common drugs.</SUM>
