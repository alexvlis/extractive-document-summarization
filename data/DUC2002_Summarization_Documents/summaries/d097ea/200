Hurricane Hugo approached the Carolina coast on Sept. 21, 1989 with its windspeed up 
to 125 mph and threatened to hit between Savannah, GA and Charleston, S.C. It hit 
Charleston head-on with winds of 135 mph and then proceeded northwestward hitting 
other population centers rather than heading up the coast or out to sea as expected. 
Fortunately Hurricane forecasters analyzing computer predictions, satellite data, the 
history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane made an accurate 
educated guess as to the point of landfall in time for threatened residents to evacuate. 
As a result, only 17 deaths resulted in all of South Carolina and only two in Charleston 
which took the brunt of the storm. Charleston had been through many hard times in its 
300- year history, but Hugo was by far the worst hurricane in its experience. Total 
insured losses from Hugo were estimated near $5 billion but insurers were confident 
that they could handle all claims. Disaster aid came to Charleston from an unexpected 
source. Kingston, New York  raised funds to aid Charleston in thanks for 1,000 New 
York pounds sent by the South Carolina governor in 1778 to help the citizens of 
Kingston after it was burned by the British.</SUM>
