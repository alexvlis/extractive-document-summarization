Pinpointing the exact location of Hurricane Hugo's landfall was difficult, but forecasters 
analyzed computer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the 
current path of the hurricane to make an educated guess which turned out to be right. 
What is more important, they came up with the answer in time to allow people to 
evacuate the South Carolina coast. But forecasting hurricanes is still not an exact 
science. The most difficult problem with Hugo was predicting the intensity of the storm. 
The last-minute increase in the wind speed of Hugo was provided by Air Force 
reconnaissance, i.e. by flying aircraft into the hurricane.</SUM>

Hurricane Hugo struck South Carolina Thursday after thousands of coastal residents 
were evacuated inland. By late afternoon the storm was upgraded to category 4. 
Hurricane-force winds first hit the coast at 9:15 p.m. and by midnight 119 mph winds 
were reported in Charleston and up to 135 mph as the eye passed nearby. Hugo was 
expected to turn north and cause severe flooding as it passed up the coast. As of 
Thursday evening about 12,000 people had checked into 83 shelters across South 
Carolina. A spokesman for the Red Cross said that tens of thousands of people were in 
shelters along the Eastern seaboard.</SUM>

As Hurricane Hugo's 135 mph wind roared outside, Charleston S.C.'s mayor Joseph P. 
Riley, city officials and a few reporters stayed in Charleston's City Hall watching the 
storm's fury. The building's tin roof ripped off and water seeped down into the City 
Council chamber. Phone and electric service to the city command post was knocked 
out. When the eye of the storm passed, Riley took reporters out of the 188-year-old 
building to look at the damage. The tin roof was in the gutter, slate tiles were scattered 
on the ground. Bricks, sticks and leaves littered the street. "It's scarcely a late summer 
breeze," he commented.</SUM>

Hurricane Hugo advanced on Georgia and South Carolina today as 150,000 coastal 
residents fled inland on jammed highways. The leading edge of Hugo with winds up to 
125 mph from 105 mph yesterday, is likely to hit between Savannah, Ga. And 
Charleston, S.C. any time after 8 p.m. A hurricane warning was in effect between 
Fernandina Beach Fla., and Oregon Inlet, N.C. In South Carolina Gov. Campbell sent 
400 National Guardsmen to help evacuate coastal counties where about one-fifth of the 
state's 3.1 million residents live. In Georgia Gov. Harris declared a state of emergency 
in six counties and 142,000 were advised to leave their homes.</SUM>

Hurricane Hugo did not simply wreak devastation on the Carolinas; it brought about 
repayment of a long overdue debt. Kingston, N.Y., the capital of New York in 1777, was 
burned by the British in October of that year. New York Gov. George Clinton received 
from South Carolina Gov. Abraham Livingston a letter dated March 31, 1778 enclosing 
1,000 New York pounds  "...for the charitable purpose of alleviating the distresses of the 
now-indigent inhabitants of the town of Kingston...". A local historian remembered the 
letter and now Kingston is raising money to help Charleston, S.C. recover from the 
ravages of Hugo.</SUM>

Hurricane Hugo has put to test the city of Charleston, S.C. which has survived 
earthquake, battle and storm in its 300-year history. The storm with winds reaching 135 
mph hit Charleston head-on Thursday night, the first major hurricane to strike 
Charleston since Hurricane Gracie made landfall 70 miles to the south in 1959. 
Charleston has survived a tornado that killed 32 people, injured hundreds and caused 
$2 million in property damage in 1938, shot and shell of two wars, any number of 
smaller hurricanes, and the earthquake of Aug. 31, 1886 that measured 7.7 on the 
Richter scale, killed 110, and destroyed 102 buildings.</SUM>

Local authorities credit residents who showed respect for hurricane warnings for the low 
casualty rate from Hurricane Hugo. Charleston S.C. bore the brunt of Hugo's fury, but 
only two of the state's 17 deaths were in the Charleston area. A local Red Cross official 
estimated that 18,000 residents of Charleston and surrounding counties headed for 
shelters and tens of thousands  motored inland. Charleston Mayor Riley said that those 
in shelters and those who evacuated inland "...were potential victims of injury and 
death." North Charleston Mayor Bourne credited people for heeding the warnings, 
saying "It was bad, but it could have been a lot worse."</SUM>

The two biggest home and auto insurers in the Carolinas estimated Tuesday that 
claims from Hurricane Hugo will reach $600 million, making it the most expensive ever. 
State Farm expects claims of $500 million and Nationwide estimates $100 million. 
Damage from Hugo was particularly high since it hit Charleston directly and then veered 
northwest hitting other population centers rather than heading out to sea. Overall 
damage to insured property will far exceed the record $752.5 million from Hurricane 
Frederic in 1979. Overall 1989 catastrophic losses for the industry now total about $1.6 
billion and Hugo will probably make this year the costliest to date.</SUM>

Damage from Hurricane Hugo which hit the Carolinas and Caribbean last week will 
reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers. American International Group expect 
a reduction in pretax earnings of $35-45 million with reinsurance covering most 
damages above $35 million. St. Paul estimates the pretax cost of Hugo as less than 
$50 million after its reinsurance contracts are figured in and Cigna is estimated to have 
a 35-45% reduction in after-tax per share earnings. State Farm expects its total claims 
for Hugo to reach $500 million which is more than three times the record $165 million 
for Hurricane Alicia in 1983.</SUM>

Losses to insurers from Hurricane Hugo far surpass the $752.5 million for Hurricane 
Frederick in 1979, but analysts and company officials predict no increase in premium 
rates before mid-1990. Mr. Ruoff of Fred S. James figures that even if losses reach $5 
billion insurers won't feel enough "financial pain" to make them boost premium rates 
right away. In the last three years hurricane and storm seasons have been rather mild 
so insurers haven't had to dip into reserves. Most insurers also protect themselves by 
buying reinsurance, and even State Farm, which doesn't buy reinsurance, believes its 
reserves are large enough to absorb its losses.</SUM>
