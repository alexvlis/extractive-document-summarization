Damage from Hurricane Andrew is estimated at $20 billion, with only $8 billion covered 
by insurance.  The last serious hurricane caused $4.2 billion in insured loses in 1989.  
American insurers most affected by claims from Andrew are the State Farm Group, 
Allstate, Hartford Insurance, Aetna, and Travellers.  General Accident, the leading British 
insurer, expects their claims to rise as high as $40 million, which means the company 
may be able to pass losses on to external reinsurers.  

Andrew hit the Bahamas, killing two, then on August 24 tore through southern Florida, 
where 15 were killed and power outages and polluted water plagued the residents for 
several days.  The city of Homestead and the nearby air force base were flattened.  In 
Dade County, 250,000 people are without homes.  After gathering strength over the Gulf 
of Mexico, Andrew next smashed into Louisiana, killing two and injuring dozens.  It did 
miss the important oil refineries, but damaged crops and the oyster and alligator 
businesses.  Andrew was downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved inland.

While Andrew ravaged the land, the dollar sustained a similar assault.  Bond yields rose 
as the Dow Jones and the dollar fell.  Insurance stock also fell, but home construction 
stock had big gains.</SUM>
