Damage from Hurricane Andrew is estimated at $20 billion, with $8 billion covered by 
insurance.  American insurers will take the brunt of the claims, but General Accident, the 
leading British insurer, expects claims to rise as high as $40 million.  Andrew tore 
through southern Florida, leaving 15 dead, power outages, and polluted water in his 
wake.  Homestead and the nearby air force base were flattened.  In Dade County, 250,000 
people are homeless.  Andrew next smashed into Louisiana, killing two.  It missed the 
important oil refineries, but damaged crops and the oyster and alligator businesses.  The 
dollar sustained a similar assault.</SUM>
