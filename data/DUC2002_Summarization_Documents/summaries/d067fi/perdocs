United States cities along the Gulf of Mexico are preparing for Hurricane Andrew, one of 
the fiercest in decades.  The hurricane has already hit the Bahamas and Miami, Florida.  
United Kingdom insurance experts say losses already could exceed $15 billion, but the 
brunt of the losses will be among U.S. insurers.  Claims against UK companies are 
expected to be below 75 million pounds.  Andrew is gathering fresh strength in the Gulf 
of Mexico and is expected to hit the Mississippi or Louisiana coast, possibly New 
Orleans, tomorrow night or Thursday.  It may threaten offshore oil facilities.  Power 
outages still plague southern Florida.</SUM>

Damage from Hurricane Andrew could rise to $20 billion, making it one of the costliest 
this century.  It is expected to make landfall soon and officials in Mississippi, Louisiana, 
and Texas have ordered two million people to evacuate and many refineries are closed. 
Fifteen people have been killed and damage in Florida is estimated to be $15 to $20 
billion.  Homestead and the nearby air force base were virtually flattened.  The U.S. 
insurance industry will take the brunt of the losses.  Primary insurers include the State 
Farm Group, Allstate, Hartford Insurance, Aetna, and Travellers.  The last serious 
hurricane caused $4.2 billion in insured losses in 1989.</SUM>

Hurricane Andrew smashed into Louisiana yesterday, damaging rural areas, but missing 
New Orleans.  Damage in southern Florida was much greater than was previously 
believed, reaching more than $15 billion.  Much of it was not insured.  Insurers will face 
the greatest loses from the destruction of $100,00 to $150,00 houses in Homestead, where 
one big hotel also was badly damaged.  In Louisiana, the hurricane hit rural and 
agricultural areas and spawned tornadoes.  The oil-refining industry was spared.  Andrew 
was downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved inland.  Two million Floridians remain 
without electricity or safe water.</SUM>

The cleanup from Hurricane Andrew has begun in Louisiana, where the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency has set $77 million aside for recovery.  The oil 
refineries were spared, but the oyster and alligator industries and the cotton and 
sugarcane crops were affected.  In Florida, local officials are criticizing emergency relief 
efforts.  Supplies of food and water have been slow.  The government estimated cleanup, 
relief, and rebuilding will cost $20 to $30 billion.  In Dade County, 250,000 people are 
without homes.  Fifteen people were killed in Florida, with two believed dead and dozens 
injured in Louisiana.</SUM>

General Accident, the leading British insurer, said yesterday that the claims arising from 
Hurricane Andrew could reach as high as $40 million.  If they do, "external catastrophe 
reinsurance covers will be exposed", meaning General Accident can pass its losses on to 
external reinsurers.  If this happens, the company will suffer a post-tax loss of $40 
million.  This information was provided during an extraordinary shareholders' meeting 
yesterday.  General Accident, with a branch in Orlando, has .5 percent of the Florida 
market.  The company's adjusters estimate total insured losses may reach $8 billion, 
within total damages of more than $20 billion.</SUM>

While Hurricane Andrew wreaked havoc across the southern United States, the dollar 
sustained a crisis.  Most on the dollar damage was inflicted a week ago when bond yields 
jumped sharply and the Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 75 points.  
Flimsy efforts to hold back a tidal wave of selling failed.  The dollar crisis has been 
building for some time.  The U.S. economy has not climbed out of the recession.  Now 
high bond yields will make it hard for the Fed to cut interest rates.  Hurricane Andrew did 
impact the financial markets.  Insurance stocks tumbled, while home construction stocks 
took big gains.</SUM>
