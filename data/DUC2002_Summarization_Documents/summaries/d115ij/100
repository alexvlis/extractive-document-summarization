The official death toll in Sunday's pre-dawn Himalayan earthquake is 981, 704 in Nepal 
and 277 in India. Many, especially in Dharan, Nepal, died when brick houses that used 
rain loosened mud between the bricks, collapsed in the 6.5 (Richter scale) quake. Bihar, 
India, where authorities say 200 died, is also threatened by flooding.  Monsoon rains and 
aftershocks hampered relief efforts and the search for victims throughout the quake area. 

Of Nepal's 157 Peace Corps volunteers, 154 have been found safe. India has no Peace 
Corp workers. 

The U.S., Britain, and the international community are sending aid to the devastated area.</SUM>
