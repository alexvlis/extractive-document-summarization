On Friday, Nepal updated its death toll from Sunday's Himalayan earthquake to 704 as 
reports arrived from remote area. 

In India, the official death toll rose to 277, 200 of which were in Bihar, but the press and 
others claim as many as 1500 may have perished. Bihar is also threatened by flooding 
from swollen rivers.

The quake, measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale, struck at 4:54 a.m. (local). According to 
Nepal's Department of Geology, it was centered near Udayapur, Nepal. Monsoon rains, 
overflowing rivers, submerged bridges and roads and aftershocks hampered relief efforts 
and the search for victims in throughout the quake area.

In Dharan, Nepal, over 131 bodies were found, most in collapsed houses that had used 
mud, loosened by rain, between the bricks. Karna Hyanju, a former Nepalese legislator, 
however, did not die in the quake. He was killed after being accused of distributing relief 
supplies only to his supporters. 

All but three of Nepal's 157 Peace Corps volunteers have been found safe. There are no 
Peace Corp workers in India. 

The U.S. is sending financial aid to both counties. Britain, U.N. agencies and the Red 
Cross sent medical teams to Nepal.</SUM>
