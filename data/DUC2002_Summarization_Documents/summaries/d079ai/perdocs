U.S. weather officials are calling Gilbert the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the 
Western Hemisphere.  Its winds were clocked at 175 mph and on Tuesday the barometric 
pressure at its center was the lowest ever measured.  Tropical force winds extend for 
more than 200 miles around the center.  Gilbert has been declared a Category 5 storm but 
has a storm surge, the dome of water that follows the eye, of only 8-12 feet.  This is only 
the third Category 5 since detailed records were begun.  The worst natural disaster in U.S. 
history was a 1900 hurricane that killed more than 6,000 people.</SUM>

Hurricane Gilbert has weakened today to a tropical storm.  The hurricane killed at least 
109 people and left more than 800,000 homeless as it barreled through the Caribbean and 
Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.  Tropical storm Gilbert is now 50 miles southeast of 
Monterrey, Mexico and continuing to weaken, although a flash flood danger remains.

southern Texas on Friday and Saturday.  Heavy rains are expected in the Rio Grande 
valley and later up the Mississippi valley.  Gilbert was responsible for billions of dollars 
of damage during its week-long rampage.</SUM>
