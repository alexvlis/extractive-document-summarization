Hurricane Gilbert has been downgraded to a tropical storm and is bringing heavy rain, 
flooding, and mudslides to northeastern Mexico.  Ten policemen were swept away in 
Monterrey and buses full of evacuees were lost in Matamoros.  Gilbert's feared path onto 
the Texas Gulf Coast did not materialize, although a number of tornadoes were spawned 
on Friday and Saturday.  In Mexico, relief operations are continuing in order to bring 
food, water, and medical supplies to survivors.

Gilbert formed in the eastern Caribbean and for the last week rampaged through the 
Caribbean, bringing destruction to the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and the Cayman 
Islands.  Damages in Jamaica, where six were killed, are estimated at $8 billion.  On 
Tuesday Gilbert was upgraded to a Category 5 storm, the highest category and only the 
third recorded.  Winds were clocked at 175 mph and the lowest pressure ever recorded in 
the Western Hemisphere was measured at its center.  Wednesday Gilbert slammed into 
the Yucatan Peninsula with 160 mph winds, severely damaging the resort areas in 
Cancun and Cozumel, severing electricity and communications over a wide area, and 
causing widespread flooding.  

Gilbert has killed at least 109 people and left at least 800,000 homeless.</SUM>
