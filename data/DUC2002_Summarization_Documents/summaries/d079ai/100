Gilbert is now a tropical storm, bringing heavy rain, flooding, and mudslides to 
northeastern Mexico.  It did not hit Texas as feared, but did spawn tornadoes.  The 
Hurricane Gilbert formed in the eastern Caribbean and during the last week ravaged the 
Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and the Cayman Islands.  On Tuesday Gilbert had winds 
of 175mph and the lowest pressure ever recorded and was upgraded to a Category 5 
storm, the highest.  Wednesday it slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula severely damaging 
the resort areas, severing electricity and communications, and causing widespread 
flooding.  At least 109 people have been killed and 800,000 left homeless.</SUM>
