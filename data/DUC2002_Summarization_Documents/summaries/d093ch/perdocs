An overcrowded ferry without life jackets capsized Saturday morning in the monsoon-
swollen Ganges River. The two-decker boat was in 12-30 feet of water 100 yards from 
shore. 400 died, including 300 on the lower deck where women and children rode.  Five 
hundred thirty-five passengers were aboard the 35-year-old steam-powered ferry 
designed to carry 160. Passengers protested when 150 wheat bags were loaded too. 
Strong currents and poor visibility hampered rescue efforts.  The trip is used by Hindu 
pilgrims crossing the river to a shrine. This was India's worst ferry accident ever. In July 
1970, 150 died when a boat capsized in the Krishna River.</SUM>

An overcrowded ferry sank Wednesday night where the Ilisha, Tetulia, and Meghna 
Rivers meet in southern Bangladesh. It went out of control while turning, in 22 feet of 
water. The ferry carried double its authorized capacity of 100. People on the roof swam 
to safety but 100 drowned, including most of those in the hull. Another ferry on the 
Meghna River, the M.V. Sagar, was attacked by river pirates Tuesday near Chandpur. 
Fifty pirates boarded as passengers, and shortly before midnight fired rifles and hurled 
homemade bombs.  Two hundred passengers were wounded and six thrown overboard. 
The pirates took $83,000 and escaped in waiting boats.</SUM>

An overloaded ferry taking 183 Qiongzhong County students and teachers on a field trip 
to visit a hydroelectric power station capsized Wednesday, killing 55. The passengers and 
four crew members exceeded the ferry's capacity. The ship sank before it had sailed 200 
yards, off Hainan Island in southern China. On September 22, another overloaded ferry 
sank in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region bordering Vietnam, killing 61. After 
133 died July 21st, when a ferry capsized on the Min River in SW Sichuan Province, and  
71 died July 25th, when a passenger boat sank on the Yangtze River, the Ministry of 
Communications began investigating river vessel safety.</SUM>

Fifty-nine people drowned Sunday afternoon when a  Caribbean passenger ferry sank 
while being towed into port by a tugboat. The ferry Justo Rufino Barrios II ran out of fuel

The 30-ton ferry Justo Rufino Barrios II, which sank off Guatemala's east coast Sunday, 
was authorized to carry 90 passengers but had 120. It ran out of fuel midway on a 16-mile 
run across Amatique Bay from Livingston to Puerto Barrios. The skipper of a patrol boat 
towing it to port requested that 22-year-old ferry captain Juan Pablo Ezquibel take control 
of the ferry's wheel, but Esquibel did so only when the boat began to capsize, after 
passengers ran to one side when the boat leaned while riding a small wave. Sixty-seven 
people drowned and 14 are missing. Esquibel was arrested for negligent homicide.</SUM>

The Israeli ferry Tuvia capsized shortly after midnight on Saturday, while bringing 100 
sailors who were part of the multinational force arrayed against Iraq back from shore 
leave to the USS Saratoga. The ferry took on water over the stern in heavy seas and 
capsized when it was hit by a big wave. Nineteen sailors drowned and scores were 
injured. Survivors described chaos as overloaded rescue boats threw life preservers and 
dragged men back to the Saratoga, which was anchored outside Haifa harbor. One sailor 
who dove from the ferry and swam frantically to escape the sinking boat's suction was hit

A ferry carrying 600 Somalis struck a reef and sank Friday off Kenya, near the tourist 
resort of Malindi. One hundred thirty bodies were recovered but 50 more were believed 
still trapped. Most who drowned were on the lower deck. First word of the accident came 
when survivors staggered into a hotel, which sent rescue boats. The ferry was one of a 
stream of vessels bringing Somali refugees to Kenya after rebels overthrew Somali 
President Siad Barre in late January. The month-long fighting had largely stopped but 
refugees continued to flee to Kenya. Eleven Somalis drowned when a boat capsized north 
of Malindi on February 1st.</SUM>

US Navy aircraft helped search for 471 missing from the ferry Salem Express, which 
sank Saturday night in shark-infested Red Sea waters. Some of the 178 survivors said the 
crew abandoned them. The 1,105-ton Egyptian-registered ferry, completing a 36-hour 
trip from Jiddah, went down six miles off the Egyptian coast after inexplicably leaving 
standard navigational channels and ramming a coral reef in stormy 10-foot seas.  
According to press, the vessel was taking a shortcut. Authorities warned it back on course 
but winds sent it out of control. All but 10 passengers were Egyptians, many Muslims 
returning from pilgrimages to Mecca or guest workers returning from Saudi Arabia.</SUM>

The ferry Salem Express, returning from Jiddah, sank off a Red Sea port Saturday night 
when stormy seas tossed it into a coral reef. Four hundred sixty-two are missing. Some 
survivors say life-preserver-clad crew pushed passengers aside and took the life boats. 
The engineer denies this, saying only 10 crew surviving out of 71 indicates no 
widespread negligence. He himself helped save passengers. The ferry sank within 15 
minutes. Water entered through a hole in the ship's side and through boarding doors. All 
but 10 of the 649 passengers were Egyptian, many Muslims returning from pilgrimages 
to Mecca or from working in Saudi Arabia.</SUM>
