Wal-Mart founder, Sam Walton, who died in April 1992, revolutionized
discount retailing.  Born in Oklahoma, the son of a mortgage banker,
he became the richest man in America and the second richest in the
world.  After a tour in the army and working in and owning retailing
outlets, he founded Wal-Mart Discount City in 1962.  He took discount
shopping to rural America and by 1992 Wal-Mart was the world's largest
retailer.  Success can be attributed to Sam's personality.  He was
frugal, hardworking, old- fashioned, and homespun.  He declared the
customer always right and continually nurtured employee satisfaction
with bonus payments, profit-sharing plans, and a responsive,
streamlined, management system.  He was known for pop-in visits,
talking with customers, and personally helping out in an emergency.

Sam Walton also worked to preserve his personal legacy.  In 1990 the
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Visitors Center opened to chronicle the rise of
the chain.  He also wrote his autobiography, filling it with anecdotes
about his "good ole" common sense.  A scholarly book was released in
1994, which highlighted his ability to copy and adapt and addressed
some of the negative aspects of the giant chain, including its
anti-union stand and its impact on small town Mom-and-Pop
stores.</SUM>
