The northern California earthquake of October 17, 1989 caused extensive 
damage to buildings and roadways. An official of the California Seismic Safety 
Commission said that assessing the disaster was "like the blind man trying to 
feel an elephant." Another on-site observer commented that the quake "was like 
somebody slugging a punching bag. Usually earthquakes pass, but this one went 
on and on...It was very very bad." Estimates of the loss to insurers ranged from 
$2 billion to $4 billion. Ironically, despite the record losses to insurers, insurance 
company stocks posted strong gains as investors bet that market forces and 
action by state regulators would result in higher insurance rates and long-term 
profits. In Washington the Bush White House flew into a whirlwind of activity to 
show the administration's ability for rapid response. In Sacramento Governor 
Deukmejian called a special session of the California legislature to deal with the 
disaster, but was perceived as blaming others for the collapse of freeways. 
Critics called on him to stop pointing fingers and get on with reconstruction. The 
Governor had earlier opposed an increase in the gasoline tax intended to 
augment transportation funding -- a step which appeared highly desirable after 
the quake left hundreds of thousands of commuters unable to reach work.</SUM>
