On Monday President Bush and the USS Iowa commander attended a memorial at 
Norfolk Naval Air Station for 47 sailors that were killed in an explosion of the 
battleship's No. 2 gun turret last Wednesday.

The Iowa, a WW II battleship returned to duty in 1982, was conducting firing exercises 
near Puerto Rico at the time. The Defense Department said the blast possibly originated 
with a gunpowder bag used to fire the one-ton shells. Eleven people inside the turret, all 
on the lowest deck loading powder, survived. 

The Navy is investigating the accident. Firings of the 16-inch guns have been suspended.</SUM>
