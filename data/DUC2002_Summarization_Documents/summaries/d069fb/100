Political unrest and a collapsing economy prompted tens of thousands of skilled East 
German workers to rush through recently opened borders to West Germany.  Western 
leaders saw that a reunified Germany was possible.  The East bloc communists, initially 
opposed to the idea, softened by urging reunification as a longer-term goal, to be reached 
in gradual stages.  Serious concerns about the future relations of NATO and the Warsaw 
Pact, the impact a strong, united German state would have on the evolving European 
integration, trepidation by neighboring states and the fears of Jews world-wide had to be 
addressed.  Reunification occurred.  It was inevitable.</SUM>
