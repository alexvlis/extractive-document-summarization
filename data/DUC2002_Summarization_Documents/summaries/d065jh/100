Indiana Senator Dan Quayle, 41, George Bush's surprise choice for vice-president in 
1988, was criticized as a novice. His National Guard service and campaign gaffes were 
attacked. He proved a low-profile team player and Bush announced he would be on the 
1992 ticket. Quayle's grandfather owned the newspaper in Quayle's hometown of 
Huntington. Quayle, known always as a nice guy, graduated from DePauw in 1969, took 
National Guard training, then in 1971 worked in the Indiana Attorney General's office 
and for the governor. At Indiana University Law School he met and married his wife 
Marilyn. They practiced law together before Quayle spent 12 years in Congress. They 
have three children.</SUM>
