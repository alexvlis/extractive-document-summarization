Indiana Republican Senator Dan Quayle, 41, was chosen by George Bush to be his  
presidential running mate. Quayle, from Huntington, Indiana, graduated from a small 
liberal arts college, DePauw University, in 1970 and went to work in the Indiana 
Attorney General's office. He met his wife Marilyn, 39, when they were law students at 
Indiana University in Indianapolis. They married in 1972 while still in school. They have 
three children, 14-year-old son Tucker, 12-year-old son Benjamin, and 9-year-old 
daughter Corinne. Quayle is said to be the same nice guy he was in law school. His sister 
Martha Saddler lives in Huntington.</SUM>

Republicans compare vice-presidential nominee-designate Dan Quayle to Thomas 
Jefferson because he has "the same fire in his belly" and to John F. Kennedy because 
they would be relatively the same age when running for office. Also, Quayle would have 
12 years in the House and Senate compared to Kennedy's 14, and he is rich. The media's 
comparison of him to Robert Redford, another blond, is a stigma for Quayle. In 1980 
Redford demanded he stop the look-alike references in his congressional campaign 
literature. Quayle, 41, hasn't had a chance to become a legend, but will send a message 
that the Republican Party respects young people who achieve.</SUM>

Bob Dole nominated Dan Quayle, the junior senator from Indiana, for vice president at 
the Republican National Convention in August. Dole called him one of the bright young 
lights in the Republican Party, a dedicated public servant, a forceful advocate, a staunch 
supporter of the Reagan revolution, and a devoted family man. Dole said he knew and 
trusted Quayle. Whenever needed, Quayle was ready to make tough choices and cast 
tough votes.  Quayle spent 12 years as a congressman and senator, tackling the vital 
national and international issues that affect the lives Americans and the future of our 
country.</SUM>

Indiana senator Dan Quayle, 41, Bush's surprise choice for his running mate as vice 
president, quickly encountered questions over his military record. It was suggested he  
withdraw from the ticket. Ret. Maj. Gen. Phillippi, who worked for Quayle's grandfather, 
Eugene C. Pulliam, as managing editor of the Indianapolis News, contacted the National 
Guard on Quayle's behalf in 1969 when he applied, recommending him highly. Quayle, 
a hardliner on defense matters, said he sought guard duty so he could attend law school. 
He denied using influence to get in and was proud of his six years of service. Quayle is 
upbeat and has a penchant for extemporaneous remarks.</SUM>

Republican vice-presidential candidate Dan Quayle, a 1969 DePauw University graduate, 
underwent six months of Indiana National Guard training then was hired as a research 
assistant by the Indiana Attorney General's office, in an interview arranged by an 
employee of his grandfather. Quayle helped handle consumer complaints in the spring of 
1971, and was chief investigator of the new Consumer Protection Division from July to 
mid-September, when he became administrative assistant to the governor while attending 
Indiana University Law School. 1980 campaign descriptions of Quayle as a "Vietnam-era 
veteran" were dropped after objections by combat veterans. "Active National Guard duty" 
referred to basic training and 15 days of camp each summer.</SUM>

Vice-presidential candidate Dan Quayle, 41, was seen as a political novice and relegated 
to small towns and safe GOP areas. After controversies subsided he freed himself from 
handlers and became more accessible but soon dropped off front pages. He is loyal to 
Bush and willing to be a team player but has few administration intimates. He is 
criticized as bringing no reputation or staff to the campaign, being untested, and being 
unqualified to assume the presidency. He is described as immature but not stupid, thrust 
into a situation for which he was unprepared.  Quayle as VP choice is compared to 
Nixon, chosen to appease conservatives, and political nonentity Spiro Agnew.</SUM>

During Dan Quayle's campaign, every gaffe he made was news and he refused all 
requests from national interview shows. Now one year after his election, he has appeared 
on "Meet the Press". Quayle was pleased with the seriousness of the questions but said 
little in reply. His goal in the vice-presidency has been to support the President and not 
make news. The selection of Dan Quayle as running mate was Bush's first major decision 
of his presidential campaign and was thought by many to be a bad choice. Bush 
emphasized that it wasn't by saying recently that Quayle would be on the ticket in 1992.</SUM>

important resident ever, Vice-President Dan Quayle. Quayle, 44 in February, grew up in 
a white, ranch-style house on Polk Street with parents James and Corinne and younger 
brother Chris. He loves golf and played on the high school team. In 1972 Quayle was an 
aide to Indiana Gov. Edgar Whitcomb. Dan and wife Marilyn opened a joint law practice 
in Huntington. His favorite restaurant is Nick's Kitchen. Quayle is known as a nice, 
capable guy with good values, from a nice family that runs the local newspaper. Quayle 
didn't attend the tribute, citing a busy schedule.</SUM>
