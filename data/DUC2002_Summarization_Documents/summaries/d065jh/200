Indiana Senator Dan Quayle, 41, was the surprise choice of Republican George Bush for  
presidential running mate in 1988. Quayle was compared to John F. Kennedy because of 
their similar ages and congressional service, and to Robert Redford in appearance. 
Quayle was criticized as a novice and his National Guard service attacked. His campaign 
gaffes made news, but he was loyal to Bush and a team player. After controversies 
subsided he kept a low profile. A year after the election he agreed to be on "Meet the 
Press", shortly after Bush announced he would be on the ticket in 1992, and was 
uncontroversial. 

Quayle grew up in Huntington, Indiana, population 17,000, where his grandfather owned 
the newspaper. He graduated from DePauw University in 1969, spent six months in 
National Guard training, then in 1971 investigated consumer problems in the Indiana 
Attorney General's office and became an aide to the governor. While attending Indiana 
University Law School he met and married his wife Marilyn. They jointly practiced law 
in Huntington before Quayle spent 12 years in the US Congress. Quayle has three 
children and is known as a nice guy with good values. In 1991, Huntington hosted an 
exhibit in his honor, which he didn't attend because of a busy schedule.</SUM>
