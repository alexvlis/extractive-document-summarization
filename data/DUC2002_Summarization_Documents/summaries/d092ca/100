An earthquake of magnitude 7.7 hit northwestern Iran on June 21, 1990 killing at least 
50,000 people and injuring 200,000. The quake occurred when most people were 
inside asleep and hit a coastal floodplain where loosely deposited soil shifts easily and 
caused the fragile adobe homes in the area to collapse. The Iranian president appealed 
for international aid and the response was overwhelming, including assistance from the 
United States, the first such since the hostage crisis of 1979-80. On the negative side, 
Iranian news media were slow to report on the disaster and the Iranian and U.S. 
government were blamed by their respective critics for the excessive casualties.</SUM>
