The earthquake that struck northern Iran on Thursday killing about 25,000 people 
registered 7.7 on the Richter scale. Many of the victims lived in fragile homes built of a 
ceramic-type brick or adobe that collapses easily and the quake occurred just after 
midnight, so most people were inside asleep when it hit. It occurred in an area of Iran 
where most of the buildings are on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts and 
allows structures to collapse. The quake of 7.7 magnitude was the largest ever 
recorded in that area where two major plates of the earth's crust meet.</SUM>

Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for the People's Mojahedin of Iran, claims that the Islamic 
Republic of Iran is purposely underreporting the number of casualties from Thursday's 
massive earthquake (7.3-7.7 on the Richter scale) out of a fear of  political backlash. 
Speaking before a rally today across the street from the White House in Washington, 
Gobadi claimed that while Iran has reported 36,000 dead, he has received estimates 
closer to 100,000. The government is unable to properly assist earthquake victims, he 
said, because it "has devoted all of its resources to a senseless war with Iraq and to 
oppression of the people at home."</SUM>

Iran today welcomed earthquake relief from its bitter enemy, the United States, but 
specified that aid should be channeled through the Red Cross and Red Crescent. This 
is one of the very rare instances of U.S.- Iranian cooperation since the countries broke 
diplomatic relations a decade ago. Iran reportedly said it would accept aid from all 
countries, including Iraq, but not Israel or South Africa. The earthquake which hit 
northern Iran Thursday with a magnitude between 7.3 and 7.7 killed as many as 35,000 
people. More than 6,000 people were pulled from rubble in Gilan and Zanjan provinces 
and airlifted to hospitals.</SUM>

On Sunday an anti-American newspaper in Iran blamed the United States for the death 
of tens of thousands of people in last week's earthquake, since it plundered Iran's oil 
and other resources for 25 years preventing application of the national wealth to 
development of "advanced (anti-seismic) building construction systems." After its 
expulsion from Iran, the argument continued, the U.S. imposed economic sanctions and 
launched plots that halted the renovation of the country. The paper called on Iranians to 
reject relief offers by the U.S. and "other governments whose hands are stained with 
the blood of the Iranian people." Iran has said it would welcome relief from U.S. 
humanitarian groups.</SUM>

After years of animosity, the U.S. government has come to the aid of Iran, channeling 
$300,000 in earthquake relief supplies through the American Red Cross. The U.S. military stands 
ready to provide logistical support for any  aid requested by Iran, but it is unlikely that 
Iran would accept or the White House suggest a military airlift. The quake hit northern 
Iran early Thursday, leaving 29,000 dead by the latest count, but the toll is expected to 
rise. About 400,000 are homeless. Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani has appealed 
for international aid and the American Red Cross has mobilized its local offices to raise 
funds for earthquake relief.</SUM>

Planes loaded with earthquake relief supplies are arriving in Iran from around the world, 
including one from the United States, the first such American benevolence toward Iran 
since the hostage crisis of 1979-80. Another plane carrying U.S. government aid was 
due today. Tehran radio said Sunday that 68 relief flights had landed at Tehran's 
Mehrabad airport during a 24-hour period.  Countries sending assistance to victims of 
Thursday's quake include the Soviet Union, Mexico, the Vatican, West Germany, 
Turkey, Spain, India, Austria and France. In Lebanon the Iranian-backed Hezbollah 
said its members were donating 10 percent of their salaries (about $500,000) to help 
the victims.</SUM>

Americans who rushed to donate earthquake relief funds for the Armenian earthquake 
18 months ago are responding more slowly to last week's earthquake in Iran. Relief 
agencies point out that U.S. response to events in the Middle East is not as immediate 
as to those in Europe, but expect contributions to pick up when news spreads of the 
effects on the lives of individuals. At least 50,000 people were reported killed and 
200,000 injured in Thursday's quake. AmeriCares brought a shipment of supplies from 
the United States into Iran on Sunday, the first of its kind to be accepted by Iran since 
the hostage crisis of 1979-80.</SUM>

The Iranian community of Orange County, California launched an effort Sunday to 
collect half a million dollars in money, medicine, tents, blankets and sleeping bags for 
hundreds of thousands of injured and homeless victims of the earthquake in 
northwestern Iran. Between 60,000 and 80,000 Iranians live in Orange County and 150 
Iranian doctors practicing there responded to calls for medical supplies. In Iran rescue 
efforts suffered a setback Sunday as the strongest aftershock yet with a magnitude of 
5.7 hit the rice-growing region of Rasht causing mudslides that temporarily closed off an 
important relief route. Estimated casualties have now reached 50,000 killed and 
200,000 injured.</SUM>

Iranian news media reacted sluggishly Thursday to an earthquake that left 25,000 dead 
in northern Iran. For hours the only detailed reporting by the Islamic Republic News 
Agency (IRNA) was that Tehran residents were either asleep or watching a World Cup 
soccer match when the quake hit. IRNA also underestimated the severity of the quake 
reporting 10,000 dead late Thursday while the Iranian ambassador to the United 
Nations said 25,000 had died. Official radio was off  the air when the quake hit and only 
reported the earthquake 6.5 hours later. Like IRNA radio reporting lacked color and 
description for hours.</SUM>

The earthquake that hit Iran early Thursday exacted particularly large casualties 
because people were asleep in fragile homes built on a flood plain of  loosely deposited 
soil that shifts in an earthquake. The quake that measured 7.7 on the Richter scale hit a 
mountainous section of coastal Iran at 12:30 a.m. and was the most powerful ever 
recorded in the area where two major plates of the earth's crust meet.  Most structures 
in the area are built of a ceramic-type brick or adobe that collapses easily. At least 
25,000 died and thousands were injured. Thousands were buried in the rubble of their 
homes.</SUM>
