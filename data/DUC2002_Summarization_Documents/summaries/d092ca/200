An earthquake hit Gilan and Zanjan provinces in northwestern Iran on
June 21, 1990 killing at least 50,000 people, injuring 200,000 and
leaving 400,000 homeless. The quake measured 7.7 on the Richter scale
and exacted particularly heavy casualties since it occurred when most
people were inside asleep and hit a coastal area of loosely deposited
soil that shifts, causing the ceramic-type brick or adobe homes in the
area to collapse. The Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani appealed
for international aid and the response was impressive with financial
contributions and relief supplies arriving from the Soviet Union,
Mexico, the Vatican, West Germany, Turkey, Spain, India, Austria,
France and the United States. The aid from the United States,
channeled through the Red Cross and Red Crescent and including funds
and supplies raised by Iranians in California, was the first
benevolence offered by the U.S. and accepted by the Iranian government
since the hostage crisis of 1979-80. Iranian news media reacted
sluggishly to the emergency, underestimating casualties and giving
little detailed or colorful reporting for hours after the quake
hit. In Washington Iranian opposition leaders blamed the excessive
casualties on the Iranian government and in Iran an anti-American
newspaper blamed the United States.</SUM>
