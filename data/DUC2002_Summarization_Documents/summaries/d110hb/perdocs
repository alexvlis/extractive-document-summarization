An Iraq-Kuwait crisis erupted July 17 when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein accused 
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of costing his country $14 billion in lost revenue 
because of their overproduction of OPEC oil limits.  He further demanded $2.4 billion for 
oil allegedly stolen from a common field and the cancellation of $15 billion in war loans 
that Kuwait gave to Iraq.  Through mediation by Saudi Arabia and Egypt, Kuwaiti and 
Iraqi officials met in Jiddah to negotiate issues.  Meanwhile, Iraq massed 100,000 troops 
and 300 tanks on Kuwait's border.  Iraq has historically laid claim to all of Kuwait.</SUM>

The U.N. Security Council demanded that Iraq unconditionally withdraw its invasion 
forces from Kuwait.  Iraq's U.N. representative said they would withdraw when the "free 
Kuwaiti interim government' of "revolutionary youth" who toppled the Kuwaiti 
government, and to whose aid they came, requested it.  Iraq said this was an internal, not 
a U.N. matter.  The Kuwaiti ambassador to the U.N. said this was "a false, flimsy 
pretext" and if not deterred in a decisive manner, all international relations will be 
threatened.  The U.S. declared that it stands with Kuwait.  Kuwait wants its negotiations 
with Iraq mediated by the Arab League.</SUM>

Iraq invaded Kuwait today, quickly seizing the palace and government buildings.  Iraq 
said it invaded at the request of revolutionaries who had already staged a coup.  Kuwait's 
emir fled to Saudi Arabia.  Kuwait's government appealed for U.S. military intervention.  
The attack had wide-ranging ramifications:  Oil prices soared.  President Bush froze 
Iraqi assets in the U.S. and blocked most Iraqi imports, including oil.  The Soviet Union 
halted weapons sales to Iraq.  The U.N. Security Council denounced the invasion.  The 
Pentagon diverted an aircraft carrier group toward the gulf.  Baghdad said it might 
withdraw soon.  Borders were closed and foreigners were asked to lay low.</SUM>

An Arab League Council meeting of foreign ministers was convened in Cairo at Kuwait's 
request.  The Council failed to publicly condemn Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.  So far, only 
Lebanon's prime minister and foreign minister, Salim Hoss, has joined Kuwait to 
publicly condemn this invasion--the first time in modern history one Arab country 
invaded another to take control of the government.  Iraq claims it entered Kuwait at the 
request of a Kuwaiti revolutionary group that had overthrown the government.  Kuwait 
has invoked the 1950 Arab joint defense pact, which requires pact members "to repel 
[invader] aggression and restore security and peace."</SUM>

Council voted 14-0 to condemn the invasion.  Iraq's U.N. representative said the U.N.

Iraq, a country of more than 17 million, using 100,000 troops and 350 tanks invaded and 
quickly conquered Kuwait, an oil-rich state, with 1.9 million residents--60 percent of

Iraq ended its eight-year war with Iran with an estimated $70 billion debt.  These war 
bills keep the government from delivering promised benefits to the Iraqi people.  Iraq 
also wishes for a longer gulf coastline.  Recently Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of 
costing Iraq billions by overproducing oil, thus driving down its price, by stealing oil 
from a contested border field and by demanding repayment of war debts.  He seemed 
determined to solve his financial and territorial ambitions by conquering his neighbor.  
Iraq has always refused to recognize Kuwait's independence.  He could also use this 
invasion to browbeat other neighbors on local policy issues.</SUM>

Emphasizing that the Central Intelligence Agency was not surprised by Iraq's invasion of 
Kuwait, a spokesman said the agency gave useful and timely information to policy 
makers and continues to do so.  President Bush had been warned that what originally 
looked like an Iraqi bluff was quickly turning into a serious deployment.  Among the 
assessments conveyed was a conclusion that President Saddam Hussein's force would be 
capable of penetrating Kuwait or Saudi Arabia.  Furthermore, as the buildup grew, the 
CIA became more alarmed because Hussein is so unpredictable and because he has been 
known to carry out his threats.</SUM>

Arabia, fearing Iraqi reprisal, would not take the potent action of closing the pipeline that

The United States urged the U.N. to impose broad economic and military sanctions on 
Iraq.  The world body is expecting 14 members of the 15-member Security Council to do 
so, Cuba being the holdout.  It would be the first time since 1967, when it brought 
sanctions against Rhodesia, that the Security Council took such action against a member 
state.  Kuwait's U.N. ambassador said that the Iraqi-installed government was employing 
"pure blackmail" by saying it could not ensure the safety of foreigners if their 
governments support sanctions.  The U.N. role assumes increasing significance since the

As punishment for not withdrawing its forces from Kuwait, the U.N. Security Council 
voted to impose trade and military sanctions against Iraq, including a ban on oil 
purchases.  It was only the third time in the U.N.'s 45-year existence that it voted 
sanctions against a member state.  The sanctions are legally binding for all member 
nations, although past resolutions have often been ignored or flouted.  Earlier, the Iraqi-
installed military government of Kuwait warned other nations to not take punishing 
measures against it or Iraq, ominously saying that such countries "have to remember they
