Iraq's powerful army invaded Kuwait early on 2 August 1990. The small Kuwait army 
offered little resistance. Kuwaiti government buildings were occupied and 350 Iraqi tanks 
swept toward the southern oilfields. The invasion followed Hussein's claim that Kuwait 
stole oil from a disputed border area, and exceeded OPEC production quotas. Kuwait 
dismissed Iraq's claim that a Kuwaiti revolutionary group invited the invasion. Iraq had 
signaled the coming of the invasion by moving 100,000 troops to the border, and CIA 
warned that it might well occur.

The United Nations Security Council immediately condemned the invasion, and on 6 
August voted 13-0 to impose sweeping trade and military sanctions against Iraq. United 
States. Japan and the European community had already cut off the importation of Iraqi 
oil. Oil prices soared. Iraq felt an almost immediate effect, and closed one of the pipelines 
that carries export oil across Turkey. Iraq retaliated by rounding up westerners in Kuwait, 
and moving some to Baghdad.

President Bush denounced the invasion. A United States aircraft battle group moved into 
the Arabian Sea. Saddam Hussein warned the Iraqi populace that United States might 
attack. Bush only said that all options were open.</SUM>
