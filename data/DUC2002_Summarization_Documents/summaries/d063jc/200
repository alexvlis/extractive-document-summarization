An explosion at 8:28 A.M. on 22 September destroyed a military barracks in Deal, a town
southeast of London in County Kent. The barracks was home to the Royal Marines
School of Music. Ten military bandsmen were killed, and as many as 22 were injured,
eight seriously.

Neighbors expressed shock at the strength of the blast. No serious injuries to civilians
were reported, but neighboring homes suffered heavy damage.

The IRA claimed responsibility for the attack, linking it what they called a warlike
speech delivered by Mrs. Thatcher during a recent visit to Northern Ireland. Investigators
said the damage was illustrative of that caused by a bomb. The IRA has a record of
attacking military installations, and this latest attack was the more damaging than any in
more than seven years. The Prime Ministers of Britain and Ireland have denounced the
attack. Police are seeking three men with Irish accents who lived near the barracks for a
short time.

Private security firms serve the barracks at Deal and 29 other bases in Britain. Families of
the victims and opposition party leaders have criticized the arrangement, blaming the
attack on lax security because of the private guards.</SUM>
