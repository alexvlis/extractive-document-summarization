<s docid="LA042590-0152" num="10" wdcount="31"> The Discovery astronauts 
triumphantly launched the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope one orbit 
late today after last-ditch commands from Earth freed a stuck solar 
panel, narrowly averting a daring emergency spacewalk .</s>

<s docid="AP900425-0198" num="36" wdcount="16"> Discovery was 380 statute 
miles above Earth, 70 miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown.</s>

<s docid="AP900422-0032" num="34" wdcount="26"> During Hubble's 15-year 
journey through space, astronomers expect to look back to nearly the 
beginning of time and solve some of the universe's most perplexing 
mysteries.</s>

<s docid="AP900424-0048" num="33" wdcount="23"> During its 15-year working 
lifetime, the telescope will provide astronomers with 10 times better 
resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based 
observatories.</s>

<s docid="AP900424-0048" num="37" wdcount="21"> The telescope is named for 
the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered during the 1920s 
that the universe is expanding.</s>

<s docid="AP900428-0050" num="11" wdcount="34"> The Hubble Space Telescope 
was awakened from its self-induced sleep today but it was still without 
the use of its high-speed antennas, and its science instruments were on 
hold, unable to begin any observations.</s>

<s docid="AP900426-0135" num="18" wdcount="23"> The telescope's low-gain 
antennas, which receive and transmit information at a much slower rate 
and can be used in emergencies, were working well.</s>

meanwhile, packed their gear for a return to Earth Sunday, made some 
last-minute observations of Earth and talked with ground-based 
reporters about their flight.</s>
