Saddam accused Kuwait of costing Iraq billions by exceeding OPEC production quotas 
thus driving down oil prices.  He further accused Kuwait of "stealing" Iraqi oil from a 
common oil field on their border.  He then invaded Kuwait, claiming to do so at the 
request of Kuwaiti revolutionary coup leaders.  The United States led the western world 
and the United Nations in calling the coup a sham, denouncing this invasion and 
imposing strong economic and military sanctions on Iraq in an attempt to get them to 
withdraw.  Oil prices surged while Saddam warned against foreign intervention.  The 
U.S. dispatched warships to the area.</SUM>
