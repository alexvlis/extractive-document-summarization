It appeared that Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was determined to solve his countries 
financial problems and territorial ambitions by conquering Kuwait.  Iraq emerged from 
its 1980-1988 war with Iran with a debt of approximately $80 billion.  Saddam accused 
Kuwait of costing Iraq billions in oil revenues by exceeding OPEC assigned oil quotas, 
thus driving down the price of oil.  He further accused Kuwait of stealing Iraqi oil from 
an oil field common to their border and also of conspiring with the United States and 
Israel to weaken Iraq economically and militarily.  Breaking off perfunctory negotiations 
with Kuwait, Iraq invaded, claiming it responded to a request for help from Kuwaiti 
revolutionary coup leaders.  Iraq quickly overwhelmed a mismatched Kuwaiti military, 
captured the capital and continued south to the oil facilities.  The United States called the 
coup a farce.  Kuwait's U.S. ambassador asked the United States to intervene militarily.  
U.S. President George Bush called for an "immediate and unconditional" withdrawal of 
Iraqi forces from Kuwait.  Although not willing to publicly discuss military options, Bush 
said all U.S. options remained open.  His administration led a United Nations embargo of 
Iraqi exports, including oil, and Iraqi imports.  Iraq retaliated by rounding up hundreds of 
foreign nationals in Kuwait.</SUM>
