The Kuwaiti Embassy announced on Wednesday that Iraqi troops had launched an 
offensive against Kuwait.  Earlier, Iraq had moved about 100,000 troops to its Kuwaiti 
border after claiming that Kuwait's production of oil beyond quotas of the OPEC cartel 
had depressed the world price, thus diminishing Iraq's revenue, and that Kuwait had been 
stealing oil from a field that straddles the border.  On Tuesday, John Kelly, a State 
Department spokesman, told a House subcommittee that the United States has no treaty 
obligations mandating military support for Kuwait; however, we do believe strongly in 
respect for territories of all states in the region.</SUM>

Iraq claimed victory today in its lightning invasion of this small, oil-rich kingdom.  
Kuwait's army was no match for Iraq's.  Kuwait's U.S. ambassador said the Iraqis 
occupied all government buildings in the capital and were moving south toward the oil 
facilities.  He appealed for U.S. military intervention.  The Iraqi government claimed that 
it invaded at the request of Kuwaiti revolutionaries who had already staged a coup.  
Kuwait and U.S. diplomats labeled the coup a farce.  The al Sabah family has ruled this 
city-state for almost 250 years.  Kuwait's leaders are safe in Saudi Arabia.  Kuwait's 
airport and borders are closed.</SUM>

Only hours after some 350 Iraqi tanks crossed the border, they entered Kuwait's capital 
and seized the ruler's palace and other government buildings.  The Iraqi government of 
President Saddam Hussein said the Kuwaiti government had been overthrown.  The 
whereabouts of Kuwait's ruler, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, is not known.  The Bush 
administration demanded immediate withdrawal of Iraqi forces.  The British called the 
incursion a threat to peace and the U.N. began an emergency Security Council meeting.  
Iraq, the size of California and with approximately one million troops among its 17 
million population, warned that any foreign troops who interfered would be attacked.</SUM>

In Kuwait, with the sound of gunfire, artillery and military jets streaming overhead, the 
entire foreign community is staying indoors.  The crisis began on July 17 when Saddam 
accused the Kuwaitis of trying to wreck his debt-ridden economy with oil overproduction 
and of stealing Iraqi oil from a border oil field.  He also demanded that Kuwait turn over 
the Gulf island of Bubiyan and forgive multi-billion dollar loans incurred by Iraq during 
its 1980-1988 war with Iran.  The invasion came a day after talks between Iraq and 
Kuwait collapsed.  Today's fighting sent oil prices surging in international markets.</SUM>

Within hours after invading Kuwait, Iraqi forces had captured the capital and were 
continuing on toward the oil facilities.  The attack had wide-ranging ramifications:  Oil 
prices soared.  President Bush froze Iraqi assets in the U.S. and blocked most Iraqi 
imports including oil.  The Soviet Union halted weapons sales to Iraq.  The aircraft 
carrier USS Independence with a six-ship battle group has been diverted toward the gulf.  
Meanwhile, Kuwait's leadership is safe in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait's U.S. ambassador 
has appealed for American military intervention.  Bush would not publicly discuss 
military options.  Foreigners in Kuwait, including many Americans, are keeping a low 
profile.</SUM>

Iraq's President Saddam Hussein seemed determined to solve his financial problems and 
fulfill territorial ambitions by conquering Kuwait.  He accused Kuwait of costing Iraq 
billions in lost oil revenue by exceeding OPEC assigned quotas and by "stealing" oil 
from a disputed field that straddles their borders.  Further, he was incensed that Kuwait 
was demanding repayment of its estimated $15 billion in 1980s wartime loans to Iraq.  It 
is believed Saddam would use the Kuwaiti precedent to dominate neighboring countries 
on policy issues.  He has long sought to inherit the mantle of the late Egyptian President 
Nassar as leader of the Arab world.</SUM>

The events between Iraq and Kuwait from July 17 through August 2 resulted in war.  
Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of driving down oil prices by overproduction thereby 
costing Iraq billions in lost revenues, of stealing Iraqi oil from a common field along their 
border, and of conspiring with the U.S. and Israel to weaken Iraq.  Kuwait suggested that 
Iraq's belligerence was to force Kuwait to forgive billions of Iraqi war debt.  Kuwait 
accepted an OPEC plan to halt overproduction of oil.  Iraq then amassed troops on 
Kuwait's border, pulled out of talks being held in Saudi Arabia with Kuwait to resolve 
issues and attacked.</SUM>

President Bush embargoed all U.S. trade with Iraq and froze that nation's assets while 
refusing to rule out the use of force to rescue Kuwait from its Iraqi invaders.  Oil from 
Iraq accounts for 3% to 4% of total U.S. supplies.  An international embargo on Iraq 
would be painful for Europe and Japan who are very dependent on Middle Eastern oil.  
Margaret Thatcher said that the U.N. Security Council would support measures that 
collectively can be agreed to and be made effective.  Although U.S. military options seem 
limited, President Bush says the U.S. would insist on "immediate and unconditional 
withdrawal" of Iraqi troops.</SUM>

Kuwait's new Iraqi-installed government claimed that Iraqi troops began pulling out of 
Kuwait on Sunday.  But White House Press Secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said that we 
have no independent confirmation of that, and furthermore, Saddam Hussein's past 
actions have created serious skepticism about his intentions.  Baghdad said it replaced 
Kuwait's ousted monarchy with a new government made up of nine Kuwaiti army 
officers.  Kuwait's embassy in Jordan dismissed this new government as "a list of fake 
names."  There was no indication that Iraqi forces had moved into Saudi Arabia, even 
though they are reported to be within miles of the Saudi border.</SUM>

The United States urged U.N. members to impose broad economic and military sanctions 
on Iraq.  The world body is expected to do so.  The U.S. had circulated drafts of a 
resolution calling for an embargo on Iraq's oil exports, an embargo on imports to Iraq, 
and a halt to all arms and military supplies to Iraq.  Kuwait's U.N. ambassador said that 
the Iraqi-installed government was employing "pure blackmail" by saying it could not 
ensure the safety of foreigners if their governments support sanctions.  The U.N. role in 
the crisis assumed increasing importance after divided Arab nations cancelled an 
emergency summit on the invasion.</SUM>

Today, Iraq struck back by rounding up hundreds of foreign nationals in Kuwait as the 
U.N. Security Council overwhelmingly approved sweeping trade and military sanctions 
to punish it for invading Kuwait.  The U.N. vote was 13 to 0 on the 15-member council.  
Cuba and Yemen sustained.  World oil prices soared to their highest level in more than 
four years.  While last year's oil revenues totaled more than $11 billion, Iraq has been 
pressing for higher oil prices in order to rebuild its war-torn economy and settle foreign 
debts of approximately $80 billion.  Warning Iraq, President Bush says all U.S. options 
are open.</SUM>
