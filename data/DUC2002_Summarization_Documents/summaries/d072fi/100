America's maestro, Leonard Bernstein died at 72 on October 14.  Suffering from lung 
diseases since spring, he announced his retirement four days earlier.  "Lenny" was the 
first American conductor to attain world fame.  He composed both classical and popular 
music and introduced thousands to classical music on television.  He made more than 200 
classical recordings, many now being examined for re-release.  Posthumous plaudits have 
come from everywhere, with memorial classical concerts in New York and Los Angles, 
as well as a goodbye from Broadway.  His 70th birthday celebrations had featured all-star 
fundraising concerts at the Tanglewood Music Center and Carnegie Hall.</SUM>
