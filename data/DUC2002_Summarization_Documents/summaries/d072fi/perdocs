Leonard Bernstein returned to Carnegie Hall with the New York Philharmonic on 
Monday, exactly 45 years after his triumphant conducting debut.  He first conducted here 
as an emergency fill-in with no rehearsal.  That concert was nationally broadcast and 
catapulted Bernstein to fame at age 25.  The shimmering performance, the 1,215th time 
he conducted this orchestra, consisted of three Bernstein compositions--"Chichester 
Psalms", a serenade, and a symphony.  Performers from his first concert attended on 
Monday night, including a violinist who played on both occasions.  Bernstein had 
celebrated his 70th birthday this summer at Tanglewood and asked on Monday, "Will this 
birthday never end?"</SUM>

Conductor Leonard Bernstein has cancelled several performances in Japan due to 
exhaustion and lingering illness.  He will return to the United States to recuperate.  His 
doctor announced he never fully recovered from ailments he suffered in the spring and 
needs complete rest for an extended period. Bernstein had been scheduled to conduct the 
London Symphony Orchestra in four performances in Japan and appear with young 
musicians during the Pacific Music Festival.  He inaugurated the festival last month, 
believed to be the first festival in Asia where young musicians can train with a 
professional orchestra.  Bernstein issued a separate apology to his fans and sponsors.</SUM>

Conductor Leonard Bernstein is giving up performing because of poor health.  The 72-
year-old, a former heavy smoker, suffers from a variety of lung disorders and has had 
increasing difficulty in breathing. He plans to participate in the October 28 AIDS benefit, 
but cancelled all other appearances.  He intends to continue composing, writing, and 
recording.  Bernstein's announcement dismayed the music world, especially at the New 
York Philharmonic which he conducted 1,244 times and is designated the laureate 
conductor for life.  He is known for his vigorous style and adventurous concerts.  
Bernstein, a successful composer, was the first American conductor respected throughout 
the world.</SUM>

Leonard Bernstein, the Renaissance man, died Sunday at 72 from lung disease.  He had 
remarkable talent and expertise in conducting, composing, playing the piano, and 
teaching, which he combined with a unique theatrical flair in both his professional and 
private lives.  He was born of Russian Jewish immigrants, began the piano at age 10, and 
was educated at Boston Latin School and Harvard University.  He was mentored by the 
great musicians of the era.  Perhaps his greatest successes were conducting the New York 
Philharmonic and composing "West Side Story" for Broadway.  He was a heavy smoker 
and drinker with an uproarious, liberal, life style.</SUM>

Leonard Bernstein, the first internationally acclaimed American maestro, was buried 
privately today beside his wife at Greenwood Cemetery in Brooklyn.  Flags at the 
Lincoln Center, the home of the New York Philharmonic, were lowered in his honor.  
The Philharmonic plans an all-Bernstein program through October 23.  A memorial 
concert is also planned at Carnegie Hall on November 14.  A gymnastic conductor, he 
also composed classical and popular music, and introduced thousands to classical music 
on his television series.  Musical director Zubin Mehta and Larry Kert, who first played 
Tony in Bernstein's "West Side Story", praised him today.</SUM>

Expanded and accelerated release programs already have begun for recordings by 
Leonard Bernstein, one of the most documented conductors in history.  Sony Classical 
will begin its three-year release of 75 CDs in January.  Deutsche Grammophon is looking 
at his discography.  They had released a CD set in August called "The Bernstein 
Edition", which is "selling well."  BGM Classics/RCA Red Seal plans a March re-release 
of Bernstein's first commercial recordings from the 1940's.  He had over 200 classical 
recordings, but only six videos are available in the home market--three 1971 Beethoven 
programs and three movies with scores he composed.</SUM>

The New York Philharmonic began its Leonard Bernstein memorial concert series 
tonight, four days after his death.  Although he had led 74 orchestras, the New York was 
his.  He was laureate conductor and had led it 1,244 times.  The scheduled night of 
Beethoven and Shostakovich became four Bernstein creations.  His whimsical "Candide" 
and eclectic "Serenade", with soloist Glenn Dicterow, lightened the mourning mood.  But 
after the intermission, it returned with "Jeremiah."  Then, mezzo-soprano Wendy White 
wept during "Lamentations."  The Hebraic elegy, "Chichester Psalms", was last on the 
program.  It ends with Bernstein's message for society.  The program will be repeated 
three more times.</SUM>

Many tributes for Leonard Bernstein are planned for Sunday in Los Angles.  The 
Philharmonic will play a tribute, as will the American Youth Symphony at Royce Hall.  
The Glendale Symphony will observe a moment of silence.  Last Monday, KUSC-FM 
devoted an entire day to broadcasting performances of Bernstein's compositions.  
KKGO-FM also devoted considerable airtime to his work on Tuesday and Wednesday.  
Another measure of grief over his death was the special public condolences in the 
obituary section of the New York Times, where 14 separate tributes had been purchased.  
The Times obituary editor said it perhaps was not too unusual considering his 
prominence.</SUM>

Tom Tugend paid tribute to Leonard Bernstein in his Letter to the Editor of the Los 
Angles Times.  He describes his memory of the Renaissance man of music.  In October 
1948, Tugend was an American volunteer in the Israeli army during its War of 
Independence.  He attended a performance of the Israel Philharmonic with Bernstein as 
guest conductor.  The audience of patrons and soldiers was hearing an emotional 
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.  Toward the end of the first movement, machine-gun fire 
broke out in the old city and continued intermittently through the performance.  "Lenny 
and the orchestra, never missed a beat."</SUM>

Leonard Bernstein was remembered on Wednesday by a concert on the stage where he 
made his conducting debut 47 years ago.  The Carnegie Hall concert included selections 
from Bernstein's "Mass" and "Chichester Psalms."  The overture of "Candide" was 
played with a symbolically empty podium.  Speakers included his three children, son-in-
law, and friends, Lauren Bacall and Schuyler Chapin.  Performers included Mstislav 
Rostropovich, Marilyn Horne, Christa Ludwig, Jerry Hadley, and Chester Ludgin.  The 
first chair musicians from orchestras around the world took part.  Wednesday also was 
the 90th birthday of Bernstein's close friend, Aaron Copland, and the 36th anniversary of 
Bernstein's first TV broadcast.</SUM>

The Broadway theatrical community said goodbye Thursday to Leonard Bernstein at the 
Majestic Theater.  The public started lining up at 7 a.m. to join invited friends, relatives 
and theatrical personalities.  Arthur Laurents, the librettist for "West Side Story", was 
host.  Other collaborators, original cast members, and old friends, several coming from 
California, spoke and performed.  His son, Alexander, delivered an affectionate talk, 
while Michael Wager, a very close friend at the end, spoke movingly about Bernstein's 
final illness.  The program closed with Marilyn Horne singing "Somewhere", the 
emotional anthem from "West Side Story."  A sustained standing ovation ended the 
evening.</SUM>
