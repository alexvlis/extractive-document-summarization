Leonard Bernstein--pianist, composer, conductor, teacher, TV personality, liberal, and 
bon vivant--died at 72 on October 14, just four days after announcing his retirement from 
conducting.  He had been in failing health since last spring, suffering from a variety of 
lung diseases, and cut short a Japanese tour in July.  He was buried on October 16.  
"Lenny", the first American conductor to attain world fame, was the well-educated son of 
Russian Jewish immigrants.  A member of the first class at Tanglewood, he achieved 
instant stardom at 25 as an emergency fill-in to conduct the New York Philharmonic on 
nation-wide radio.  He conducted this orchestra over 2000 times.  He composed both 
classical and popular music and introduced thousands to classical music on television.  
He made more than 200 classical recordings, many now being examined for re-release.  
Plaudits have come from everywhere and the New York Philharmonic presented four all-
Bernstein nights of classical selections.  In Los Angles, three orchestras and two radio 
stations honored him.  On November 14, his career was commemorated at Carnegie Hall 
and Broadway said goodbye on December 13.  He had savored the celebrations of his 
70th birthday, which featured all-star fundraising concerts at the Tanglewood Music 
Center and Carnegie Hall.</SUM>
