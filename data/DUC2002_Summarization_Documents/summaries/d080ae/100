The McMartin Pre-School child molestation trial, the longest criminal trial in U.S. 
history, ended with a verdict of innocent for Raymond Buckey and is mother, Peggy 
McMartin Buckey. The jury found the Buckeys innocent on 52 of the charges but 
deadlocked on another 13, causing a mistrial on those charges. Prosecutors must now 
decide if they want a retrial on the deadlocked charges. Originally involving 7 
defendants, including Raymond Buckeys sister and grandmother, the charges against the 
sister and grandmother as well as three employees of the school were dropped. Parents of 
the children involved expressed anger and disappoint at the verdict.</SUM>
