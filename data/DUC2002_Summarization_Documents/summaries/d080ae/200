The McMartin Pre-School child molestation case, the longest and costliest criminal trial 
in U.S. history ended with the acquittal of Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy 
McMartin Buckey, on 52 charges. A decision has yet to be reached on whether to retry 
Buckey on the 13 charges on which the jury deadlocked. The case originally involved 
Buckey and his mother, as well as his sister and grandmother and three other employees 
of the school. The charges against the sister, grandmother and the three employees were 
dropped for lack of evidence. In reaching their verdict, the jury said that the videotaped 
interviews of the child were a factor in finding the Buckeys innocent. The jurors felt the 
interviewers asked leading questions and never allowed the children to tell their own 
story. A number of the jurors stated that they believed some of the children had been 
molested but that the prosecution had not proven that Raymond Buckey was responsible. 
The verdict was greeted with anger by the parents of the children involved who felt the 
prosecution and the legal system had let them down. The judge in the case remarked that 
the case had poisoned everyone it touched.</SUM>
