<s docid="LA011990-0091" num="10" wdcount="40"> Ray Buckey and his mother, 
Peggy McMartin Buckey, were found not guilty Thursday of molesting 
children at the family-run McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach, a 
verdict which brought to a close the longest and costliest criminal 
trial in history .</s>

<s docid="LA011990-0091" num="89" wdcount="51"> The McMartin case -- which 
included allegations not only of rape, sodomy, oral copulation, and 
other sex crimes, but also of pornographic photography sessions, "naked 
games," field trips away from the school for illicit purposes, animal 
mutilation, threats and satanic-like ritual and sacrifice -- began in 
the fall of 1983 .</s>

<s docid="AP900118-0183" num="45" wdcount="29"> Originally, there were seven 
defendants, including Raymond Buckey's sister, Peggy Ann Buckey, and 
Virginia McMartin, the founder of the school, mother of Mrs. Buckey and 
grandmother of Raymond Buckey.</s>

<s docid="AP900117-0193" num="9" wdcount="31"> Jurors who have reached 
verdicts on 52 counts in the McMartin preschool molestation case said 
Wednesday they are deadlocked on the remaining 13 charges in the 
nation's longest, costliest criminal trial.</s>

<s docid="AP900118-0190" num="11" wdcount="45"> Seven jurors who spoke with 
reporters in a joint news conference after acquitting Raymond Buckey 
and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, on 52 molestation charges 
Thursday said they felt some children who testified may have been 
molested _ but not at the family-run McMartin Pre-School.</s>

<s docid="LA011990-0091" num="63" wdcount="18"> Said jury foreman Luis Chang, 
an electrical engineer: "The key evidence that swayed me was the 
interview

<s docid="AP900119-0024" num="19" wdcount="13"> But the jurors were sharply 
critical of the interviewers' technique at the institute.</s>

<s docid="AP900119-0024" num="20" wdcount="19"> ``The children were never 
allowed to say in their own words what happened to them,'' said juror 
John Breese.</s>

<s docid="LA011990-0091" num="127" wdcount="54"> * Therapist Kee MacFarlane, 
who conducted many of the interviews in which children first disclosed 
that they had been molested, came under fire when it was revealed not 
only that she had minimal previous experience in the field but also 
that she was involved romantically with the television newsman who 
broke the story .</s>

<s docid="AP900118-0183" num="10" wdcount="30"> Thursday's acquittals in the 
McMartin Pre-School molestation case outraged parents who said 
prosecutors botched it, while those on the defense side proclaimed a 
triumph of justice over hysteria and hype.</s>

<s docid="AP900118-0183" num="27" wdcount="26"> ``The system is not going to 
protect children,'' said Jackie McGauley, a parent who believes her 
child had been molested but didn't testify in the case.</s>

<s docid="LA012090-0110" num="69" wdcount="40"> As it becomes apparent that 
McMartin cases will stretch out for years to come, parents and the 
former criminal defendants alike are trying to resign themselves to the 
inevitability that the matter may be one they can never leave 
behind.</s>
