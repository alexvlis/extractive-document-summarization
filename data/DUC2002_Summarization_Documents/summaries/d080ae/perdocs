The McMartin Pre-School molestation trial, the nation's longest and costliest trial, ended 
with the acquittal of Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey on 52 
charges of child molestation. The jurors deadlocked on 13 others charges. Parents of 
children who attended the school were upset upset because they felt the system was not 
going to protect children. The current district attorney, Ira Reiner, blamed his predecessor 
and defense attorneys. Reiner had earlier dismissed charges against five of the original 
seven defendants. Former District Attorney Robert Philibosian dismissed accusations that 
he played up the case to boost his public profile when he ran for district attorney.</SUM>

Jurors cited taped interviews by the Children's Institute International as a reason for 
acquitting Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, on 52 charges of 
child molestation. The jurors felt that CII interviewers asked leading questions and never 
allowed the children to tell the story in their own words; contaminating the evidence. 
Jurors said they couldn't tell if the children believed what they were saying or were 
repeating what parents or CII interviewers had told them. The jurors deadlocked on 13 
other charges. While unsure if Buckey was a molester, jurors were sure that the 
prosecution had failed to prove the molestation allegations.</SUM>

The longest criminal trial in U.S. history, the McMartin Pre-School molestation case, 
began in August 1983 with a telephone call to the Manhattan Beach police. This began a 
series of events which led to the arrest of Raymond Buckey, his mother Peggy McMartin 
Buckey, his sister Peggy Ann Buckey, his grandmother Virginia McMartin and three 
employees, Mary Ann Jackson, Babette Spitter, and Betty Raidor. Charges were dropped 
against all by Buckey and his mother in January 1986 and the trial of the remaining two 
began in April 1987. The case finally ended on January 18 1990 when  the were 
acquitted.</SUM>

Although the McMartin Pre-School criminal trial, the longest and costliest criminal trial 
in history has ended although civil suits generated by the case could continue to years. 
Suits and counter-suits include a federal civil rights suit filed by Peggy McMartin Buckey 
against her accusers. The former defendants have also fled a lawsuit against a television 
station and reporter and the pre-school owners have filed against their liability insurance 
carriers. It is anticipated that many parents will file civil suits against the school, the 
defendants and the insurance company. Civil suits only require that nine of 12 jurors 
agree, offering a better chance of success.</SUM>

Jurors in the McMartin pre-school trial remained deadlocked on 13 of the charges 
brought against Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buskey.  The 
decisions on the 52 charges in which they have reached a verdict will remain sealed until 
a decision is reached on how to proceed on the deadlocked charges. Jurors were confused 
on some points of law in the deadlocked charges, especially on how to reach a verdict on 
the charge of conspiring between the two defendants; failing to see how they could find 
one, but not both, innocent of the charge. Jurors are in their ninth week of deliberation.</SUM>

Anger greeted Thursday's acquittals in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case. While 
the defense claimed a triumph of justice over hysteria and hype, irate parents blamed the 
prosecution of being inept. Jurors found Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy 
McMartin Buckey, innocent of 52 charges against them. No verdict was reached on 13 
other charges and prosecutors must decide if they wish to call a new trial on those 
charges. Jurors, while admitting that some of the children may have been molested, stated 
that it did not mean they were molested at the McMartins school. The case was the 
longest and costliest in U.S. history.</SUM>

Although Therapist Kee McFarlane defended her work in the interviewing of hundreds of 
children for the McMartin Pre-School molestation trial, jurors were critical of the 
interview techniques. The jurors, in acquitting the Buckeys on 52 of the charges,  felt that 
leading questions were asked and that the children were never allowed to tell their own 
story. McFarlane is a social worker and director of the Child Sexual Abuse Center at the 
Children's Institute International. CII video tapes of the interviews were introduced as 
evidence at the trial. One juror said she would have believed the children more had the 
tapes not been introduced.</SUM>

The McMartin Pre-School case appears to be headed for television and the bookshelf. At 
least one screenwriter, Abby Mann, has been working on a retelling of the 6-year-old 
case almost from the beginning. After gaining the confidence of the defendants, Mann, 
along with his wife Myra and former prosecutor Glenn Stevenson, were hired as 
investigators by the defense. An 800 page manuscript also is in the works for Random 
House. Some television producers expressed reservations about accepting a film about 
the McMartin trial, citing possible legal problems since 13 of the charges remain open in 
the case.</SUM>

The Rev. John D. Eales of St. Cross Episcopal Church in Hermosa Beach announced that 
he would seek a disability retirement on the recommendation of his doctors because of 
the severe stress. Rev. Eales is a victim of the McMartin trial. Although neither the 
church nor any of its officials, including Eales, were ever formally charged, the church 
was subject to repeated vandalism and threats over the years because of the 1985 claim of 
a former McMartin's student who claimed he had witnessed satanic rituals and animal 
sacrifices at the church. Even though the charges were never substantiated, the threats 
and vandalism continued.</SUM>

The disappointment and anger following the acquittal of Raymond Buckey and his 
mother Peggy McMartin Buckey on 52 charges of child molestation, is reflected in the 
words "Ray must die" scrawled on the McMartin Pre-School. Although the jury 
deadlocked on the remaining 13 charges, some expressed the wish that prosecutors not 
retry the Buckeys on these counts, saying it would only be the same circus. Most parents 
of children involved in the case expressed disappointment with the legal system, citing 
the defense for prolonging the case and the prosecution for not doing enough research to 
prosecute the case properly.</SUM>

The McMartin Pre-School child molestation case, the longest and most costly criminal 
trial in U.S. history, closed with a verdict of not guilty for Ray Buckey and his mother, 
Peggy McMartin Buckey. The eight man, four woman jury deliberated for nine weeks 
before acquitting the Buckeys of 52 counts of molestation. A mistrial was declared on 13 
other charges on which the jury remained deadlocked. Most of the jurors later said they 
believed that the children who testified had been molested but that the prosecution had 
not proven that the Buckeys were responsible. Disappointed parents expressed anger at 
the legal system and the prosecution.</SUM>
