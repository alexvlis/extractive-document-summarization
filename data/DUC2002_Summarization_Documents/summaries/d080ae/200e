Peggy McMartin Buckey, were found not guilty Thursday of molesting 
children at the family-run McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach, a 
verdict which brought to a close the longest and costliest criminal 
trial in history .</s>

<s docid="AP900118-0183" num="45" wdcount="29"> Originally, there were seven 
defendants, including Raymond Buckey's sister, Peggy Ann Buckey, and 
Virginia McMartin, the founder of the school, mother of Mrs. Buckey and 
grandmother of Raymond Buckey.</s>

<s docid="AP900118-0190" num="11" wdcount="45"> Seven jurors who spoke with 
reporters in a joint news conference after acquitting Raymond Buckey 
and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, on 52 molestation charges 
Thursday said they felt some children who testified may have been 
molested _ but not at the family-run McMartin Pre-School.</s>

allowed to say in their own words what happened to them,'' said juror 
John Breese.</s>

McMartin Pre-School molestation case outraged parents who said 
prosecutors botched it, while those on the defense side proclaimed a 
triumph of justice over hysteria and hype.</s>

<s docid="LA012090-0110" num="69" wdcount="40"> As it becomes apparent that 
McMartin cases will stretch out for years to come, parents and the 
former criminal defendants alike are trying to resign themselves to the 
inevitability that the matter may be one they can never leave 
behind.</s>
