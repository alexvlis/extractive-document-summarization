On June 22, 1990 Checkpoint Charlie, the allied border crossing on the west side of the 
Berlin Wall, was hoisted by a huge crane onto a flatbed truck to be taken to a museum. 
The guardhouse, constructed after erection of the Berlin Wall in 1961, was the scene of 
many successful and unsuccessful attempts at escape from East Berlin and had 
become a symbol of the Cold War. By June of 1990 with the Berlin Wall being 
dismantled daily in anticipation of German unification, and with top diplomats of the two 
Germanys and the four World War II allies meeting in East Berlin to discuss the status 
of the city after unification, U.S. officials decided it was time to remove the famous 
landmark. The foreign ministers attended an elaborate ceremony to honor the symbolic 
act. Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze took the occasion to modify the previous 
Soviet firm opposition to a united Germany's membership in NATO, proposing that such 
a step be allowed after a five-year waiting period during which all Soviet and U.S. troops 
would leave the country. U.S. Secretary of State Baker declared himself 
"underwhelmed" by the offer, but softening of the Soviet position was a welcome sign 
appropriate to the occasion.</SUM>
