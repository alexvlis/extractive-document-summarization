A 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck northern Iran. It is the largest quake ever recorded in 
that area, striking an area where most buildings are built on a flood plain of loosely 
deposited soil. The soil shifts in an earthquake which caused the fragile ceramic-type 
brick or adobe homes to collapse easily. The casualty count was pushed up because the 
quake struck just after midnight, when people were indoors asleep. Thursday's quake was 
reminiscent of the Dec. 7, 1988 quake which devastated Soviet Armenia. That quake, 
which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale, killed about 25,000 people. Most died in 
structures that collapsed.</SUM>

The early morning earthquake which struck Iran killed at least 25,000 and injured 
thousands of others as they slept on Thursday. Scores of villages were destroyed in this 
mountainous region of coastal Iran, burying the inhabitants. The fragile homes, built on a 
flood plain of loose soil, were destroyed when the soil shifted during the earthquake, 
allowing the structures to collapse. The 7.7 magnitude earthquake is the largest ever 
recorded in the area where two major plates of the earth meet. The earthquake is very 
similar to one which struck Soviet Armenia on Dec. 7, 1988, and killed 25,000 people.</SUM>

Leaders of a group trying to overthrow Iran's Islamic leadership accused Iran of 
deliberately underreporting the number of casualties in Thursday's earthquake. Iran has 
reported that at least 26,000 were killed, but Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for the People's 
Mojahedin of Iran, speaking to a rally at a park across from the White House claimed the 
number closer to 100,000. Gobadi blamed the government for the shoddy housing that 
people were forced to live in. Gobadi further charged that the government was devoting 
all of its resources to a senseless war with Iraq. The People's Mojahedin aided in  
deposing the shah in 1979.</SUM>

In a rare instance of U.S.--Iranian cooperation, Iran said today it would accept U.S. relief 
for the victims of the earthquake which killed as many as 25,000 people. The aid will be 
channeled through the American Red Cross and other U.S. humanitarian agencies. 
Cooperation between the U.S. and Iran all but ceased a decade ago when the two 
countries broke diplomatic relations. Iran said it was willing to accept help from all 
nations except Israel and South Africa. Rescuers pulled 6,000 people from the rubble 
today. The earthquake, which measured between 7.3 and 7.7 killed than the one that 
occurred in Soviet Armenia in December 1988.</SUM>

Despite the death order which stands against him, writer Salman Rushdie donated $8,600 
to victims of last week's earthquake in Iran. Rushdie to the Independent Iranian 
Earthquake Appeal organized by the newspaper the Independent. In making the 
contribution Rushdie said humanitarian issues transcended all other discussion. Rushdie 
drew the wrath of the late Ayatollah Khomeini for writing "The Satanic Verses." 
Khomeini sentenced Rushdie to death for writing the novel, which many muslims 
consider blasphemous. Iran announced that the donation will not change anything and 
that the death sentence stands. Rushdie has been in hiding since the death sentence was 
announced in 1989.</SUM>

An editorial in the anti-American newspaper Johamri Islami in Iran stated that the united 
States is partly to blame for the thousands of deaths in last week's earthquake. Saying 
that even the people buried in the rubble chant "Death to Americans," the newspaper 
accused the U.S. of plundering Iran's resources. In doing so, the United States diverted 
Iran's national wealth from urban development projects and the construction of 
earthquake resistant buildings. The newspaper called on the U.S. to stop hatching plots 
and called on a rejection of aid from the U.S. Iran has said it welcomes relief from the 
American Red Cross and other humanitarian groups.</SUM>

Supplies, medical personnel, and condolences have begun to arrive in Iran where about 
40,000 died in an earthquake. Responding to the humanitarian need, countries both 
friendly and hostile to Tehran's Islamic government have contributed to the relief effort.

the American Red Cross. In addition to supplies, the Soviet Union sent a professional life 
saving team from the Armenian capital of Yerevan. The French have said they will send a 
mobile hospital unit if Iran wants it. Pope John Paul II also donated to the effort.</SUM>

San Diego's Iranian community was in a anxious state after receiving word of the 
earthquake in Iran. Most of the 25,000 Iranians living in San Diego were told they would 
have to to wait at least 48 hours for news of family and friends. Mohammad Nyakoui was 
more fortunate. He had talked with his wife just before the earthquake and she was able 
to call him eight hours after the earthquake to let him know that she and their two 
children were alright. The Iranian Community has begun to organize to receive donations 
of money as well as food, clothing, and medicine.</SUM>
