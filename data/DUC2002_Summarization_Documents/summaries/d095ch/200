On Tuesday, January 16, 1989, Patrick Edward Purdy entered the grounds of Cleveland 
Elementary School in Stockton, California and fired an AK-47 automatic assault rifle into 
a crowded playground. He killed five children and wounded 29 others and a teacher, then 
killed himself. 

All the dead and 19 of the wounded were children of Southeast Asian refugees, as were 
60% of the school's 970 students. Translators and Buddhist priests assisted families, who 
received financial aid from the county victim assistance program. Students returning to 
school received counseling. A South Carolina school where a similar attack occurred sent 
encouragement. Governor Deukmejian spoke at one memorial service and was 
considering a ban on assault weapon sales. Anti-racism statements were made but 
authorities denied a racial motive in the attack. 

Purdy, AKA West, 24, blond and blue-eyed, attended Cleveland Elementary  through 
third grade. He dropped out of high school and took welding classes, then drifted around 
the country searching for work. He had many LA area arrests for minor offenses, served 
jail time, and attempted suicide. He had military and white supremacist leanings. He was 
described as a loner, child alcoholic, dangerous, and mildly retarded. His father was 
struck by a car and killed in 1981. His mother remained unlocated.</SUM>
