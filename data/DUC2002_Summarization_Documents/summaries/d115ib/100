The deadliest earthquake in this region since 1950, hit near the Nepal-India border killing 
at least 750 people and injuring thousands.  The magnitude 6.5 quake, with its epicenter 
about 100 miles southeast of Katmandu, Nepal, was felt as far away as New Delhi and 
Calcutta.  The hardest hit areas were Bihar state in India and the Dharan district of Nepal.  
Aftershocks kept people terrified for days.   Earthquake damage and monsoon rains have 
paralyzed rail and road transportation thus hindering rescue efforts and isolating some 
remote areas.  In Nepal police bulldozed more than 50 houses considered too unsafe to be 
habitable.</SUM>
