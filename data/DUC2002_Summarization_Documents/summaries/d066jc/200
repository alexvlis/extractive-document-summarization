Sam Walton died in April 1992, shortly after his 74th birthday on 29 March. He rose from 
humble beginnings to become the country's richest man.  He accomplished this by dint of 
hard work, an engaging personality and willingness to defy accepted retailing practices.
After earning a college degree and serving in the army, he opened a Ben Franklin 
franchise in Arkansas. In 1962 his brother joined him and they opened the first Wal-Mart. 
When Wal-Mart was incorporated in 1971 there were 38 outlets. Wal-Mart's revenues 
then were only nine percent of Sears' and 11 percent of K-Mart's. Wal-Mart experienced 
phenomenal growth. In 1991, the year before Walton's death, Wal-Mart's revenues were 
greater than those of any other discount retailer. 

Walton eschewed the publicity that accompanied the annual Forbes' listing of the richest 
people. He spent most of his time at home in Arkansas, and whenever possible he visited 
his stores to exchange ideas with his salespeople, or as he called them "his associates".

He was criticized for putting his stores in small towns, and causing the failure of many 
small businesses. He was also criticized for his anti-union policies.</SUM>
