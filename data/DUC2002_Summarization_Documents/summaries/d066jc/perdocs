Samuel Morse Walton, son of a farm mortgage broker, was born in Oklahoma on 29 
March 1918. He earned an economics degree from Missouri University and worked for 
J.C. Penney's as a management trainee.

After a three year stint in the army Walton opened a Ben Franklin franchise, and 
eventually became the largest franchisee. He and a brother opened the first Wal-Mart 
Discount City in 1962. The brother is still a board member, and Sam's family is involved 
in the business. In 1987 Forbes estimated the family's stake in the business at about 6.8 
billion dollars.</SUM>

Customers in Wal-Mart here in Fort Walton Beach were surprised to find Sam Walton, 
founder of the discount chain, helping cashiers when an electrical glitch shut down the 
cash registers. Walton is famous for his folksy style, and the help to the cashiers came
during a surprise visit to the Florida store. He often attends promotional events such as 
the concert given by country singer Jana Jea Tuesday evening. During the concert he 
joined the singer in a duet, and the led the customers in a Wal-Mart cheer.</SUM>

The 1989 publication of the Forbes listing of the richest people again has Sam Walton as 
the nation's richest man. He has been on top since Forbes first published the listing in 
1988. This year he is in the list of the wealthiest in the world.

The annual Forbes publication makes Walton uncomfortable. He shuns the personal 
publicity that goes with his status, preferring to concentrate on Wal-Mart and pursue the 
simple life on Bentonville, Arkansas. He calls his salespeople "associates", and  
frequently visits them at one of the stores.</SUM>

The Wal-Mart Stores, Inc, will open a Visitors Center on Wednesday here in Bentonville 
on the downtown square where Sam Walton opened for business on 9 May 1950. That 
store was a Ben Franklin franchise. It was not until 1962 that the first Wal-Mart was 
opened.

The Center chronicles the growth of Wal-Mart. Today it has 1500 stores, 272,000 
employees and listed sales of 25.8 billion dollars. Displays include a replica of Walton's 
original office, and a hula skirt that he wore for his "dance on Wall Street" after the 
company surpassed the profit goal for 1984.</SUM>

Sam Walton's phenomenal success as a retailer stemmed from his personality, and his 
willingness to defy accepted retailing wisdom. By 1991 Wal-Mart was the world's largest 
retailer, as measured by revenues. His success made him very wealthy, but he did not 
take on the trappings of the opulent.

Employee satisfaction was very important to him, and he instituted policies to keep them 
happy. He put his stores in small rural towns despite warnings that they would fail. They 
were a great success but often caused the failure of many small businesses.</SUM>

Sam Walton died in April 1992. Shortly before his death he wrote about his life in a book 
entitled, "Made in America: My Story". It is the story of a happily married and well-liked 
man who lived frugally in an obscure corner of Arkansas.

Readers may find the book boring and dreary. It is full of common sense, and charming 
and humorous anecdotes. It does not directly address his company's non-union policies, 
and the impact of his 40 billion dollar giant on the mom-and-pop stores in the small 
towns where he located his stores.</SUM>

A book entitled, "Wal-Mart: Sam Walton's Retail Phenomenon" was published two years 
after Walton died. It was advertised as a "scholarly account" of Wal-Mart's success.

The chain's rise was spectacular. The company did not incorporate until 1971 when it 
had only 38 outlets and was not listed among the country's top 71 discounters. Its 
turnover was nine percent of Sears' and 11 percent of K-Mart's. Ten years later its sales 
surpassed both.

Walton studied the competition and adapted from them. Another strength was its 
openness to technology. An example was its 20 million dollar investment in an internal 
satellite system.</SUM>
