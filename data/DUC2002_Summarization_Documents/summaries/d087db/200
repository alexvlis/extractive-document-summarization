In the world of international competition, the Olympics are special.  True, world records 
can be established elsewhere, such as at the World University or the World Cup games.  
But consider, in the 1988 Summer Olympics from Seoul, Korea, at least one billion 
people, via a 115-nation worldwide TV hookup, watched more than 9,000 athletes from 
160 countries compete.  Sometimes dreams of Olympic gold are dashed, as happened to 
U.S. figure skater Debi Thomas, who, expecting gold, only placed third.  National pride 
is a factor.  The 1988 summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea gave us the first meeting 
between Soviet Union and United States competitors since 1976.  The Soviets captured 
most medals, the U.S. third most.  However, among those "third-most" U.S. competitors 
were superstar gold medalists Greg Louganis, Florence Griffith Joyner and Jackie Joyner-
Kersee. Unfortunately, at these games Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was disgraced by 
having his gold medal stripped away because of drug use.  The Olympics can lead to 
material wealth, such as experience by 1984 gymnast pixie, Mary Lou Retton or to long-
lasting fame such as that of Jesse Owens, the black American who in the 1936 Berlin 
Olympics put to the lie Adolph Hitler's theories of a master race.</SUM>
