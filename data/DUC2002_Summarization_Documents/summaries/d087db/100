In the world of international competition, the Olympics are special.  It is here that 
national pride is displayed, individual dreams are realized and fame is attained.  The 
summer Olympics with its gymnastics, track and field, and swimming events will 
showcase superstars such as Mary Lou Retton, Carl Lewis, Florence Griffith Joyner and 
Greg Louganis, some of whom capitalize on their fame and glory with lucrative 
advertising contracts.  The Winter Olympics generally highlight the figure skaters, speed 
skaters and downhill skiers.  Sometimes an Olympian acquires lifelong fame, as 
happened to Jesse Owens, who in 1936 soundly defeated Hitler's "master race" 
competitors.</SUM>
