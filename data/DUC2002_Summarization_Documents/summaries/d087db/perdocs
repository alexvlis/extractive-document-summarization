The United States' Debi Thomas' dream of Olympic gold crumbled Saturday as East 
Germany's Katarina Witt won her second straight Olympic championship and Canadian 
Elizabeth Manley took home the silver.  Thomas won the bronze despite three faulty 
landings.  Thomas, of San Jose, Calif., the first black to win a U.S. figure skating crown 
and the 1986 world champion, skated poorly Saturday after doing well earlier in the 
games.  Brian Boitano of the U.S. won the men's figure skating crown.   In the pairs 
competition, a bronze went to a U.S. team.  The U.S. also captured three speed-skating 
medals, a gold, silver and bronze.</SUM>

The Olympics wrapped up Sunday evening with a rousing closing ceremony in Calgary's 
McMahon Stadium.  The best America could do was six medals, its worst Winter Games 
showing in 52 years.  In 1936, America won just four medals, but only 51 were available 
then.  This time, 138 medals were handed out.  America's bobsled team missed a bronze 
medal by .02 seconds.  The Soviets finished first in both number of gold medals, 11, and 
in total medals with a record 29.  East Germany's athletes won nine golds, 25 overall;  
while Switzerland's team came in third in both gold, five, and overall with 15.</SUM>

Florence Griffith Joyner, 28, of Los Angeles, known for her long fingernails and colorful 
bodysuits, set an Olympic record Sunday in winning the 100-meter sprint.  In Thursday's 
200-meter race, she dashed to her second gold in 21.34 seconds, shattering the world 
mark she had set 90 minutes earlier in her semifinal heat.  She is scheduled to run the 
400-meter relay on Saturday and may compete in the 1600-meter relay that day.  Griffith 
Joyner has a chance to match the 1984 quadruple gold medal performance of U.S. 
sprinter and long jumper Carl Lewis, and by Fanny Blanker-Koen of the Netherlands in 
1948.</SUM>

The Seoul, Korea 1988 Summer Olympics closed on Sunday.  9,633 athletes from 160 
nations competed in 34 venues.  At least 1 billion people watched via a 115-nation 
worldwide TV hookup.  It was the first meeting between the Soviet Union and the United 
States since 1976.  The Soviets captured the most medals, the U.S. third most.  Among 
the U.S. highlights were championships won by Greg Louganis, Florence Griffith Joyner, 
Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Matt Biondi.  A big Olympic negative was the stripping of the 
gold medal from Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson because of drug use.  He flew home in 
disgrace.</SUM>

The 1988 Summer Olympics may well be remembered for the glory enjoyed by U.S. 
diver Greg Louganis and the disgrace experienced by Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson.  
Louganis won his second pair of gold medals after striking his on a springboard, which 
opened a cut requiring five stitches.  Johnson had his gold medal and world record 
stripped because of drug use.  Olympic officials believe that catching Johnson and nine 
other athletes with positive drug tests indicates that we will successful stop "doping".  
Surprisingly, the Soviets apparently won the hearts and cheers of the host South Koreans, 
while U.S. athletes experienced some anti-U.S. sentiment.</SUM>

It appears that Olympic gold has lost much of its commercial luster.  Following the 1984 
Olympics, pixie gymnast Mary Lou Retton signed up for $5 million in commercial 
advertisements.  No one from the 1988 Games will follow in her steps.  Marketers say 
these medalists will pull in $100,000 to $500,000 a year.  Why?  Reasons abound.  The 
games occurred halfway around the world, TV coverage was rated poor, no heroes - the 
Soviets trounced U.S. competitors and drug scandals cast a pall over the Games.  Also, 
many advertisers now prefer athletes who are in the public eye longer, like football 
players or basketball's Michael Jordan.</SUM>

The late Jesse Owens was honored on Wednesday for "humanitarian contributions to the 
race of life".  President Bush presented the Congressional Gold Medal to his widow at a 
White House ceremony.  At the 1936 Olympic games in Berlin, Owens captured four 
gold medals.  His performance put the lie to Hitlers' boasts.  "The Berlin Games were to 
be the showcase of Hitler's theories on the superiority of the master race until this 23 year 
old kid showed up," said Bush, ". . . it was a triumph for all humanity."  Mrs. Owens 
said, "Despite the many honors, his greatest satisfaction came from his work with youth."</SUM>

In tonight's Barcelona Olympics, the four relay finals will dominate the athletics.  The 
relays, more than other events, traditionally go to affluent countries that choose to lavish 
resources on athletes.  The U.S. has won the most relay medals followed by Britain, the 
former Soviet Union, former West and East Germany, then France and Canada.  Also 
tonight, Carl Lewis will pursue his eight Olympic gold.  While winning gold brings 
excitement or relief to others, Lewis just seems unsurprised.  Noureddine Morcelli of 
Algeria should win the men's 1,500-meters.  He is one of five Africans striving to 
increase their continent's current tally of three medals.</SUM>
