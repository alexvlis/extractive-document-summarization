On July 17, 1990 Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of violating OPEC
production quotas and of stealing oil from wells along the countries'
disputed border. Tension increased July 24-25 as the U.S. announced a
"short-notice exercise" in the Persian Gulf and Iraq said it would not
be intimidated by U.S. pressure. Tension eased when Iraq and Kuwait
agreed to talks, but by the time the parties met on July 31, Iraq had
massed 100,000 troops on the Kuwaiti border. The next day Iraq pulled
out of the talks and on August 2,1990 invaded and quickly occupied all
of Kuwait. President Bush froze Iraqi assets in the U.S. and blocked
most Iraqi imports. The U.N. Security Council denounced the invasion
and demanded Iraq's withdrawal. The Pentagon stepped up air patrols
and movement of warships into the Persian Gulf. When, on August 6, the
U.S.  pushed strong sanctions against Iraq through the U.N. Security
Council, Iraq struck back, rounding up several hundred Britons,
Americans, and West Germans in Kuwait, taking some of them to
Iraq. Iraqi troop concentrations menaced the Saudi Arabian border and
the U.S. warned Iraq of vital American interests in Saudi Arabia, but
as of August 6, 1990 it was a stand-off. Iraq was in possession of
Kuwait and oil prices soared on the international market.</SUM>
