Iraq's powerful army quickly claimed victory today in its invasion of Kuwait. The Kuwaiti 
Emir fled to Saudi Arabia. All of Kuwait is occupied. Kuwait's U.S. ambassador 
appealed for U.S. military intervention. Iraq's invasion followed its accusation that 
Kuwait stole oil from a disputed border area and exceeded OPEC production quotas. 
100,000 battle-tested Iraqi tank-led troops had massed on the border in recent days 
facing Kuwait's 20,300-strong armed forces. The Iraqi government claimed it invaded at 
the request of revolutionaries who had staged a coup and established "the provisional 
government of free Kuwait." Knowledgeable diplomats labeled the coup report as a 
farce.</SUM>

Iraq's army invaded tiny oil-rich Kuwait today and with a force of 100,000 quickly 
overcame the smaller country's 20,300-strong armed forces. A Kuwaiti government 
official announced that all of Kuwait was occupied. There were immediate 
repercussions.  President Bush froze Iraqi assets in the U.S. and blocked most Iraqi 
imports including oil. The Soviet Union halted weapon sales to Iraq. On Friday Soviet 
Foreign Minister Shevardnadze and U.S. Secretary of State Baker plan a joint 
statement in Moscow on the invasion, apparently lining up the two super powers on the 
same side for a change. The U.N. Security Council voted 14-0 denouncing the invasion 
and demanding an Iraqi withdrawal.</SUM>

Iraqi troops launched an offensive against Kuwait at midnight Wednesday. Two weeks 
ago Iraq moved 100,000 troops to its border with Kuwait, accusing the smaller country 
of violating OPEC oil quotas and stealing oil from a field on the border. Earlier 
Wednesday Iraqi officials had walked out of diplomatic talks in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia. In 
Washington the State Department advised the Iraqi ambassador of the U.S. desire for a 
peaceful solution to the tensions.  The United States has no treaty obligations to Kuwait 
but does have six warships in the area that have been conducting exercises with the 
forces of the United Arab Emirates, some 700 miles southeast of Kuwait.</SUM>

Iraq's occupation of Kuwait yesterday has ended two weeks of tension and 
negotiations. First, Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of flooding the oil market and of 
stealing oil from wells along the disputed border. Tension increased July 24-25 as the 
U.S. announced a "short-notice exercise" in the Persian Gulf, Kuwait declared a state of 
alert, and Iraq defied U.S. pressure. Tension eased somewhat when Iraq and Kuwait 
agreed to meet for discussions, but when they met on July 31 Iraq massed 100,000 
troops on the border facing Kuwait's 20,000-strong armed forces. The next day Iraq 
pulled out of the peace talks and yesterday invaded, quickly occupying Kuwait.</SUM>

Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's occupation of Kuwait reflects his  need to escape 
from economic and social problems arising from the eight-year war with Iran. Saddam 
says he fought the war to protect Sunni Arabs from the fundamentalist Shiite Persian 
revolution in Iran and should not be expected to repay war debts to fellow Sunni Arabs.  
By focusing on claimed misdeeds of Kuwait he hopes to divert attention from the 
economic and social chaos reigning at home while gaining the wealth and territory 
represented by Kuwait. This is the first time that an Arab state has deposed the 
government of a fellow Arab League member.</SUM>

Responding to U.N. Security Council trade and military sanctions, Iraq today rounded 
up hundreds of foreign nationals in Kuwait. (The Iraqi-installed Kuwait government had 
earlier told foreign countries not to forget their citizens in Kuwait while punishing Iraq.) 
Several hundred Britons, Americans, and West Germans were apprehended and some 
were taken to Iraq. World oil prices rose to their highest level in more than four years. 
Iraqi troops moved toward the Saudi Arabian border on Thursday and Saudi troops 
were reported moving toward the Kuwaiti frontier. In Baghdad, Saddam Hussein 
warned his nations's 17 million people to be on the alert for possible U.S. or Israeli 
attacks.</SUM>

Iraqi troops, led by the elite Republican Guard invaded Kuwait early today as Iraq 
claimed it was responding to the request from "the interim government of free Kuwait" to 
defend the revolution and the Kuwaiti people. Kuwaiti forces failed in their attempt to 
repel the invaders with heavy artillery. The rattle of automatic weapons and explosions 
in rapid succession rudely awakened residents. The British Embassy was hit by shellfire 
and the Sheraton and Hilton hotels evacuated their residents. Prime Minister Sheik 
Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah appealed on Kuwaiti radio for Arab support. Today's fighting 
quickly sent oil prices surging in international markets.</SUM>

On Thursday President Bush embargoed all trade with Iraq, froze its assets in the U.S., 
and refused to rule out the use of U.S. forces. The Pentagon stepped up air patrols in 
the Persian Gulf and began moving warships into the area. Kuwait's ambassador to the 
U.S. appealed for U.S. intervention and the State Department labeled Iraq's claim of 
responding to the request of an "interim free government" in Kuwait as a "patent fraud." 
Although Bush has refused to rule out military action, it seems unlikely in view of Iraq's 
military strength, the limited U.S. forces nearby and the opposition to U.S. intervention 
from other countries in the area.</SUM>

The new Iraqi-installed government of Kuwait claimed that Iraqi troops began a pullout 
from Kuwait Sunday, but the United States doesn't believe it. The new government is 
reportedly led by Col. Ala Hussein Ali who holds the four primary ministries. Kuwait's 
embassy in Jordan identifies Ali as Saddam's son-in-law. Meanwhile the tens of 
thousands of Iraqi troops massed near Kuwait's border with Saudi Arabia gave no sign 
of movement and as U.S., French and British warships steamed toward the Persian 
Gulf, President Bush said Friday that an Iraqi move against Saudi Arabia would be 
attacking U.S. "vital interests". He stated Saturday that use of force remains an option.</SUM>

Two weeks of tension culminated Thursday before dawn with the Iraqi invasion of 
Kuwait. The tension commenced when Iraq massed troops on the Kuwaiti border in a 
dispute over an oil field and Kuwait's violation of OPEC oil quotas. On Wednesday Iraqi 
officials abruptly walked out of diplomatic talks in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, and the next 
morning Kuwait was invaded.  The Bush administration demanded immediate 
withdrawal of the Iraqi forces and announced that it was considering all options in its 
response. U.S. warships have been on alert 600 miles to the southeast since July 24. 
The U.N. Security Council called an emergency meeting for Thursday.</SUM>

The United States has urged other U.N. members to impose broad economic and 
military sanctions on Iraq. A draft resolution calls for an embargo on Iraq's oil exports 
and on imports to Iraq, and a halt to all military supplies for Iraq. If the Security Council 
approves  these sanctions it would be the first time since 1967 that it has taken such 
action against a member state. The Iraqi-installed government of Kuwait told other 
countries to refrain from taking "punishing measures" against it or Iraq and threatened 
that they "have to remember they have interests and citizens in Kuwait."</SUM>
