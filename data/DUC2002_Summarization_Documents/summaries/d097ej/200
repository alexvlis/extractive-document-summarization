American Insurance Service Group says Hurricane Hugo, which ravaged the Caribbean 
and the Carolinas last week, is responsible for record hurricane losses. State Farm 
Insurance expects claims of approximately $500 million in the Carolinas. Nationwide 
Insurance is projecting claims near $100 million. Though the Hugo-related losses are 
substantial, most companies have sufficient funds to cover them. Some companies, 
however, will reduce third-quarter earnings.

Hugo slammed into Charleston Thursday night with top winds of 135 mph. Upgraded to 
a Category 4 hurricane hours before it struck the historic city, it caused widespread 
damage throughout the Carolinas. Only two lives were lost in Charleston, however, and 
only 17 total in South Carolina. Officials credit the low number of fatalities to residents 
who monitored the hurricane and evacuated.  

Computer models at the National Hurricane Center used satellite information to track 
Hugo's path into Charleston. Before the storm's arrival in South Carolina, the governor 
declared a state of emergency and National Guardsmen were ordered to assist a 
mandatory evacuation of coastal barrier islands and shorefront. Thousands fled inland or 
went to shelters.

Kingston, New York, assisted by Charleston during the Revolutionary War, is repaying 
the kindness by sending money to help the city recover.</SUM>
