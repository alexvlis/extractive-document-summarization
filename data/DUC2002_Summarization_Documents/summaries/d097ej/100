The two largest property insurance companies in the Carolinas, State Farm and 
Nationwide, estimate Hurricane Hugo losses at $600 million, making it the costliest 
hurricane ever.

Hugo, a Category 4 storm dubbed a "killer hurricane" by Charleston's mayor, struck the 
city Thursday night. Though there was significant damage, only two were killed in 
Charleston, 17 total in South Carolina. Officials credit the low number of fatalities to 
residents who heeded Hurricane Center warnings and evacuated before the storm's 
arrival.

Kingston, New York, assisted by Charleston during the Revolutionary War, is repaying 
the kindness by sending money to help the city recover.</SUM>
