woman's recollection of and her work as a WW II correspondent and her affair with a 
young officer. The Booker is awarded to the author of the best work of fiction published 
in Great Britain during the preceding 12 months.

publishers' submissions. The competition is very popular and elicits heavy betting. Odds 
on Lively were seven-to-one. The Booker was first awarded in 1969. The idea was to 
devise a British equivalent to the French Prix Goncourt.</SUM>

The winner of the 1989 Booker Prize, Britain's top literary award, will be announced on 
26 October. The six novels on the short-list have been named and British bookmakers 
have established Kazuo Ishiguro's "The Remains of the Day" as a seven-to-four favorite 
to win the 31,600-dollar prize. 

Interest in the Booker this year is expected to be even higher than usual this year because 
of last year's controversy. Salman Rushdie, a British citizen, was an unsuccessful 
contender last year for his "Satanic Verses". Ayatollah Khomeni alleged that the book 
blasphemed Islam, and he threatened Rushdie's life.</SUM>

Yesterday the judges announced the short-list of the six fiction writers in contention for 
the 1992 Booker Prize. This year the prize will be worth 20,000 ponds. The Booker is no 
longer the richest literary prize, but even making the short-list guarantees the author 
immense prestige and increased sales for his novel. Critics say the hype afforded Booker 
finalists does a disservice to other authors who do not make the list.

Bookmakers immediately made Michael Ondaatje's "The English Patient" the favorite to 
win the prize. The winner will be named at  Guildhall banquet on 13 October.</SUM>

Yesterday' announcement of the short-list of six contenders for the1994 Booker Prize 
elicited some biting comments. Some of those on the list were characterized as "B-Team 
Writers at the Best". This is surprising in a year of good works of fiction that meet the 
criteria for Booker consideration in that they are written in English and are non-
American. They are missing from the short-list, making the criticism more strident.

Despite the carping, there will be the usual high interest from now until 11 October when 
the winner is announced.</SUM>

The winner of the Booker Prize for 1944 will be announced on 11 October. Five days 
later the winner of the hypothetical 1894 booker Prize will be named at the Cheltenham 
Festival of Literature. It is a publishing gimmick, but it is also a fascinating exercise in 
historical reconstruction.

The short-list is a sensation. It includes such classics as Kilpling's "Jungle Book", George 
du Maurier's "Trilby", and Anthony Hope's "The Prisoner of Zenda". All the 1894 
Booker writers were popular names but also serious skillful writers whose books can be 
read with pleasure 100 years later.</SUM>

The winner of the 1994 Booker Prize is John Kelman That was announced last night. He 
won for "How Late It Is, How Late". It is the story of  Scottish low-life narrated largely 
in Glaswegian dialect. It was the least favorite of the three front-runners. Most feel that it 
is the most difficult work to have ever won the Booker.

The Booker has always provoked controversy, but this year the wrangling has been 
especially intense. Book sales have suffered. Nominated novels have been selling at a 
rate 50 percent below that of books on last year's short-list.</SUM>
