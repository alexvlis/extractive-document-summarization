The Booker Prize was first awarded in 1969. It honors the best work of
fiction by a British or Commonwealth author published in Britain
during the preceding 12 months.  The Booker is now the best known and
most prestigious fiction award in Britain. It carries a substantial
monetary prize, and is administered by Book Trust, an educational
charity. Booker, an international food and farming business, sponsors
the Prize.

British publishers can submit up to three titles for
consideration. Each year a management team selects a new panel of
judges. They announce a list of six finalists. Bookmakers establish
betting odds, and heavy betting ensues, most of it by literary
pundits. Interest builds in the period leading up to the announcement
of the winner, usually in October.  The hype that accompanies the
selection boosts book sales.

Penelope Lively's "Moon Tigers" won in 1987. Peter Carey's "Oscar and
Lucinda" won in 1988. Kazuo Ishiguro's "The Remains of the Day" won in
1989. Antonia Byatt's "Possession" won in 1990. Michael Ondaatje's
"The English Patient" won in 1992, and John Kelman's "How Late It Is,
How Late" won in 1994. In 1994 the short-list was severely criticized,
and a hypothetical 1894 Booker was contested.</SUM>
