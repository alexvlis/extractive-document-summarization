Nelson Mandela, a leader in the African National Congress' opposition to
South Africa's policy of apartheid, spent nearly 27 years in prison.  He was
sentenced to life in prison in 1964 for conspiring to overthrow the
government.  He became a rallying point for nations that were pressuring
South Africa to end its all-white government.  World leaders hailed
Mandela's release in 1990, and he was welcomed as a hero when he traveled,
including a visit to New York City.  In-fighting among black elements
complicated Mandela's role in negotiations to end white-minority rule in
South Africa.  Also, Mandela's wife, Winnie, was imprisoned, complicating
matters.</SUM>
