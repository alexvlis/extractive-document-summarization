Bush ambassadorial nominations of veteran diplomats included James
Lilley (former CIA officer) to China, John Negroponte (who as
ambassador to Honduras helped direct CIA aid to Nicaraguan rebels) to
Mexico, Deane Hinton (former ambassador to El Salvador and Costa Rica)
to Panama following the US invasion, Harry Shlaudeman (former
ambassador to Argentina, Peru, Brazil, and Venezuela) to Nicaragua
(over early favorite Melissa Wells, who had no Latin American
experience and might have faced confirmation delays), and Thomas
Pickering (experienced in delicate situations concerning Iraq and El
Salvador) to nuclear power India. Jordan saw the appointment there of
seasoned ambassador Wesley Egan as a signal of Jordan's importance to
the US.  At the UN, Foreign Service Director Edward Perkins replaced
Pickering as ambassador and Ronald Spiers got the top-ranked American
post. The ambassadorial nominations of Joseph Zappala (Spain), Marvin
Semble (Australia), Della Newman (New Zealand), and Joseph Gildenhorn
(Switzerland) were approved despite charges that their only
qualifications were large campaign contributions. Senate Foreign
Relations Chairman Claiborne Pell called the nomination of Peter
Secchia as ambassador to Italy a mistake because of his big
mouth. Routinely approved nominations included Shirley Temple Black
(Czechoslovakia), Thomas Melady (Vatican), Keith Brown (Denmark), and
William Howard Taft IV (NATO).</SUM>
