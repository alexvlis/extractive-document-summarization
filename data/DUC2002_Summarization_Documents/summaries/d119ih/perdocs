President Bush is nominating former CIA officer James R. Lilley as ambassador to 
China, to replace Winston Lord, who has headed the embassy in Beijing since 1985. 
Lilley, 60, was CIA station chief in China when Bush headed the US liaison office there 
in 1974-75. He was born in China, the son of an American oilman. He served on the NSC 
staff, headed the US office in Taiwan, and was deputy assistant secretary of state for East 
Asia.  For the last three years, Lilley has been ambassador to South Korea and hoped to 
become assistant secretary of state for US policy in East Asia.</SUM>

President Bush's nominee for ambassador to Mexico is  28-year Foreign Service veteran 
John D. Negroponte, who as ambassador to Honduras from 1981-1985, helped direct CIA 
aid to Nicaraguan rebels. Negroponte, 49, later concluded secret US aid was a mistake. 
Mexican leftists criticize the appointment but it is expected to be accepted. Rejection 
would be an unusual diplomatic slap. Negroponte was most recently a deputy to Reagan's 
last national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin Powell; and was an aide to adviser Henry 
Kissinger during the Vietnam war. He has worked on negotiations with Mexico on 
environmental and fishing issues and is known as being good at working the bureaucracy.</SUM>

Today the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 13-0 to endorse the nomination of 
Michigan Republican activist Peter F. Secchia as ambassador to Italy. Chairman 
Claiborne Pell abstained, saying the nomination was a mistake. He feared Secchiai' 
penchant for making gross remarks might embarrass the US. Tact and careful speech 
were hallmarks of successful diplomats and Secchia's qualities were opposite those. But  
since Secchia was the president's choice, he wouldn't try to block or delay the 
nomination. Secchia pledged to be more careful in his use of colorful language as a 
diplomat. Secchia is a former Republican national committeeman and lumber industry 
executive.</SUM>

Democrats said three of Bush's ambassadorial nominees -- Florida real estate developers 
Joseph Zappala and Marvin Sembler to Spain and Australia, respectively; and Seattle real 
estate broker Della Newman to New Zealand -- had no qualifications except political 
connections. Senator Paul Sarbanes led the opposition, saying the appointments were 
prompted by campaign contributions. Zappala's only government experience was 
chairing Republican campaign finance committees. The Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee narrowly approved the nominations Tuesday. Ambassadorial nominations 
approved routinely were Shirley Temple Black to Czechoslovakia, Thomas Melady to the 
Vatican,  Keith Brown to Denmark, and Joseph Gildenhorn to Switzerland. William 
Howard Taft IV was approved as permanent US representative to NATO.</SUM>

The nonpartisan American Academy of Diplomacy rated Joseph Gildenhorn, Bush's 
nominee for US ambassador to Switzerland, unqualified based on a comparison of his 
biography and the job's requirements. Gildenhorn and his family have given $230,000 to 
Republican campaigns. Twenty of Bush's first 29 ambassadorships have gone to large 
GOP contributors. Democrats complain that choice diplomatic posts are better reserved 
for Foreign Service professionals. Gildenhorn, 59, is a lawyer, real estate developer, and 
vice-chairman of the board of directors of the Sovran Bank. Other ambassadorial 
nominees rated as unqualified include Joseph Zappala (Spain), Melvin Semble 
(Australia), and Della Newman (New Zealand). All are in real estate.</SUM>

President Bush has named career diplomat Deane Hinton as ambassador to Panama. 
Hinton replaces Arthur Davis, recalled last May in protest when Noriega stole 
Panamanian elections, and sent back after the December invasion and president Endara's 
installation. Hinton was a recess appointment, meaning he can serve until the end of next 
year without Senate confirmation. Hinton, 66, has been assistant secretary of state for 
economic and business affairs, US representative to the European Community, and 
director and economic counselor of the State Department's Agency for Economic 
Development in Chile and Guatemala. He was ambassador to El Salvador from 1981-83

President Bush is expected to name a female ambassador to Nicaragua in view of  the 
election of president Violeta Chamorro. Front runner is Melissa Wells, 57, currently 
ambassador to Mozambique. Wells was born in Estonia, has no prior experience in Latin 
America, but speaks Spanish. The US and Nicaragua have not had ambassadors in each 
other's capitals since July 1988, when the Sandinista government expelled US diplomats 
on charges of interfering in Nicaragua's internal affairs. Wells' 1986 nomination as 
ambassador to Mozambique was held up for 11 months by Senator Jesse Helms, who 
wanted to pressure the administration into dealing with rightist guerrillas opposed to 
Mozambique's Marxist government.</SUM>

The Bush administration, eager to have an ambassador in Nicaragua now that Violeta 
Chamorro has taken over after 11 years of Sandinista rule, is expected to name career 
diplomat Harry Shlaudeman to the post. It had planned to send Melissa Wells but feared  
a prolonged confirmation fight because she was a previous target of conservatives. 
Shlaudeman, 64, previously ambassador to Argentina, Peru, Brazil, and Venezuela, is 
expected to win easy Senate confirmation. He agreed to the job only after being 
personally asked by Bush. The Sandinistas expelled eight US diplomats in July 1988 for 
interfering in the country's internal affairs, and the US expelled eight Nicaraguan envoys 
in return.</SUM>

President Bush plans to name UN Ambassador Thomas Pickering as US envoy to India. 
The UN role in resolving regional disputes is growing in importance, and the feud 
between India and Pakistan could become the next nuclear standoff. Pickering served in 
the UN during the delicate negotiations that led to the coalition against Iraq, and served 
as a US envoy to El Salvador in the 1980s, during Reagan's opposition to communist-
backed Central American insurgencies. He is sometimes criticized for liking media 
attention. Foreign Service Director Edward Perkins, US ambassador to South Africa in 
1986 when the US imposed economic sanctions to end apartheid, is to succeed Pickering 
at the UN.</SUM>

The choice of heavyweight Wesley Egan as new US ambassador to Jordan signals 
Jordan's importance to the US. Egan was second in charge at the US Embassy in Cairo, 
served in Saudi Arabia, two African countries, and in Europe. In confirmation hearings, 
he pledged to enhance Jordan's role in the peace process and attend to Jordanian stability, 
human rights, compliance with sanctions against Iraq, termination of the boycott of 
companies doing business with Israel, anti-terrorism efforts, and investment potential  in 
Jordan. During the hearing, Senator Moynihan's remarks mirrored an undeclared US 
policy dictated by the Zionist lobby. Moynihan stressed Jordan's lack of sovereignty over 
the West Bank.</SUM>
