Dog competition in national and international events is both entertainment and big 
business.  More than 2,500 dogs, representing 138 breeds competed for prizes at the All 
breed Dog Show and Obedience Trials at the Los Angeles Sports Arena in 1989.  In 
1988, 20,000 people attended Israel's dog of the year contest in Tel Aviv with 800 
contestants representing over 50 breeds.  The event briefly outshone Israel's general 
election and the uprising known as the intefadeh. 
 
The owners of one prize winning dog were embroiled in a law suit over whether the dog 
should be retired or not.  Stud fees were also at issue.

Weimaraners served as both companions and models to a Manhattan artist.  One of the 
dogs has appeared on the television show Sesame Street and another was world famous 
when he died at the age of 11.  The Dog Fancier's Club organized an event in New York 
City to honor the city's top police dog and the nation's top show dog.   Bill McFadden, a 
professional dog handler for various owners has close to 100 champions a year.  He says 
he makes a good living, but the overhead is high and the hours are long.</SUM>
