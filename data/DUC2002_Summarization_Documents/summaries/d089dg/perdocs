Marilyn Quayle, wife of Vice President Dan Quayle, visited the severely tornado-damaged city 
of Huntsville, AL. She praised workers, the heroes, and the corporations that have made 
donations to aid recovery. Federal and state officials have pledged to do whatever is necessary to 
help but Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco quake have squeezed relief funds.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has allocated $1.1 billion of its 
authorized $1.3 billion supplemental funding for the hurricane damage and $1.2 billion for 
California's earthquake disaster. Alabama will pay 25% of the relief costs but is urging 
donations to relief agencies.</SUM>
