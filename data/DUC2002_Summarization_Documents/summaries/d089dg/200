A powerful storm system brought tornadoes, high winds, thunderstorms Wednesday and 
Thursday across the Midwest, Mississippi Valley, Southeast, and Northeast. Reportedly, 27 
people were killed, more than 500 injured, and thousands left homeless

The worst hit was Huntsville, AL when a tornado with winds up to 250 mph laid waste a wide 
swath through the city and caused the death of at least fourteen people and injuries to over 400. 
Many were trapped for a while in vehicles, apartment complexes and shopping areas. The rubble 
was 10-14 feet deep and rescuers were hampered by darkness and plunging temperatures. State 
officials estimated the damage in excess of $100 million. Four people were killed by a tornado in 
Georgia.

Moving north Thursday, the storm caused heavy damage in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Washington, 
DC, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Delaware, New Jersey and New York. In Newburgh, 
NY, a tree crashed through a school roof killing at least seven children and injuring eighteen. 
One person died in New Jersey and another in New York City. Thunderstorms dropped large 
hailstones in Indiana and Tennessee. Kentucky and Louisiana were damaged by 65 mph winds.
