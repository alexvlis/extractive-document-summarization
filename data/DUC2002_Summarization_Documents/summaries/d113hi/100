The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) remains open following a week of onslaught.  First 
the Securities and Exchange Board of India accused the market of ignoring and failing to 
enforce rules.  The Indian market already had fallen 48 percent since early last year, 
aggravated by a negative reaction to the Indian budget.  On Friday afternoon, India's 
commercial heart, including the BSE, was hit with car bombs.  While a militant Sikh 
group claimed responsibility, Indian officials still suspect Moslem extremists seeking a 
return of communal strife.  The BSE was able to resume limited trading, but a slight rise 
was halted by an explosion Wednesday in Calcutta.</SUM>
