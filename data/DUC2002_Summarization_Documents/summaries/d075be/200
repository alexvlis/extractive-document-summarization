Medical advances combined with lifestyle changes have combined to significantly reduce 
the number and severity of heart attacks in the past decade. New medicines such as 
transforming growth factor beta (TGF) and calcium channel blockers such as Diltiazem 
and Verapamil, when administered shortly after a heart attack have reduced both the heart 
damage of the attack as well as the likelihood of a second attack. Even the simple aspirin, 
taken every other day has been shown to significantly reduce the chances of a first heart 
attack, especially when used in combination clot dissolving drugs. The FDA warns that 
further tests with aspirin are required. Aspirin may increase the chances of stroke in 
people with blood clotting problems or high blood pressure. Surgical techniques, such as 
balloon angioplasty or partial ileal bypass surgery also show promise in lowering the 
incidence of a second heart attack. Caution has been advised with angioplasty since it 
appears to be no more effective that clot-busting drugs in reducing the chances of a 
second heart attack.  Releasing the patient from the hospital as soon as possible, often 
within three days, also has a positive effect on recovery. Other factors in the reduction in 
heart attacks are changes in diet and smoking fewer cigarettes.</SUM>
