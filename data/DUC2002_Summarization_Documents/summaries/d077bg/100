A violent earthquake registering 6.9 on the Richter scale rocked Northern California on Tuesday 
causing widespread damage throughout the San Francisco Bay area. A section of both the San 
Francisco Bridge and the Oakland-San Francisco Bridge collapsed. Buildings also collapsed and 
fans at the World Series game in Candlestick Park were terrified as the stands swayed. A 1988 
US Geological Survey predicted the area where the quake actually occurred contrary to studies 
predicting the next "big one" would be in the Los Angeles area.

President Bush directed $273 million in aid although coffers were strained from response to 
Hurricane Hugo.</SUM>
