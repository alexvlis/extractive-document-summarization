The major earthquake that struck the San Francisco Bay area Tuesday occurred in a region 
targeted from previous studies by seismologists as having the highest probability of a strong 
quake in North California. The quake's magnitude as 6.9 on the Richter scale and centered in the 
Santa Cruz, CA area 75 miles south of San Francisco.

Initial reports indicated widespread damage from the quake, especially affecting highways and 
old masonry buildings. It could serve as an engineering study for any possible damage in the Los 
Angles region, which has similar construction and a higher probability of a major quake 
occurring.</SUM>

A violent earthquake registering 6.9 on the Richter scale rocked Northern California Tuesday at 
5:04 pm. One report said the quake was centered near Hollister, 80 miles southeast of San 
Francisco in San Benito County. It was felt as far away as Reno NV, 225 miles southeast.

The extent of the damage was not immediately clear. A section of both the San Francisco Bridge 
and the Oakland-San Francisco Bridge collapsed. A building and a bridge in downtown Hollister 
collapsed. A major fire was burning in San Francisco's Marina District. World Series fans in 
Candlestick Park were terrified as the stands swayed.</SUM>

A major earthquake lasting about fifteen seconds and measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale, rocked 
northern California on Tuesday evening. One section of the San Francisco Bay Bridge collapsed. 
Nearby buildings swayed several feet and some may have collapsed. Phones and power were 
knocked out.

Fans at Candlestick Park waiting for the World Series to begin screamed as the stadium swayed 
for about fifteen seconds. Fans were evacuated and there were reports of some injuries.  

The quake shook buildings in Sacramento, 95 miles to the northeast, and was felt as far away as 
Reno, NV, 225 miles to the east.</SUM>

Ever since the 1906 earthquake devastated San Francisco, many scientists believed the next "big 
one" would strike the Los Angles area. Their studies gave various interpretations of how much 
stress was released by the 1906 earthquake (magnitude 8.3). The greater the quake, the more 
stress it relieves and, thus, the longer it takes for the same size quake to occur again. In the face 
of conflicting evidence, the US Geological Survey issued a 1988 report that concluded the 1906 
quake didn't release as much stress in the San Francisco region as believed. The 6.9 quake 
Tuesday confirmed the USGS study.</SUM>

Tuesday's earthquake, the strongest on the San Andreas fault since the 1906 San Francisco 
quake, came in a place scientists identified in 1988 as the most likely in Northern California 
within the next 30 years. The 1988 report cited probabilities for major temblors along the San 
Andreas in central and southern California, but pinpointed the Santa Cruz mountains as the most 
vulnerable partly because the area marked the southernmost point of maximum ground slippage 
during the 1906 earthquake. Pressure was probably building up in the neighboring southern 
segment of the San Andreas, which had not slipped as much since 1906.</SUM>

Private groups and officials from around the world and the US offered earthquake relief to the 
San Francisco Bay area. Los Angles shipped doctors, sonic equipment, and fire investigators; 
Charleston, SC and a California brewery sent drinking water; the Salvation Army provided 
cooked food canteens; the Red Cross blood units and shelters; and the Coast Guard boats and 
helicopters.

Britain flew in engineers. Israel and France offered search teams, and Osaka, Japan sent $10,000 
in cash. President Bush directed $273 million in aid but federal and private coffers, especially the 
Red Cross, are strained by previous responses to Hurricane Hugo.</SUM>

Experience of a reporter at Candlestick Park for the World Series the night of the 1989 San 
Francisco quake:

I was sitting in a trailer outside the stadium when the earthquake hit. I looked out and the 
stadium was shaking. A special concrete joint on top of the stadium was opening and closing like 
cardboard. A few people were running out. I walked into the stadium to interview fans and 
sensed little panic. Most people stayed, waiting to hear whether the game would be postponed. 
When leaving, those in the upper deck seemed more shaken that those in lower levels.</SUM>

In the recent San Francisco earthquake, why did some luxury four-story apartments or office 
buildings collapse while high-rises escaped virtually unscathed? Accordingly, some buildings 
collapsed because of two things: very poor soil and very poor structural design. Some were built 
over landfill and others were erected earlier when there were no earthquake codes.

Four-story buildings with garages underneath have no walls on one side. Connections break and 
the front falls. Skyscrapers usually survive because architects factor in wind gusts and earth 
movement. In smaller buildings, contractors make sure that vertical forces--such as snow and 
ice--cannot force a collapse.</SUM>

A California Safety Commissioner said, "I've been wandering around San Francisco and it's like 
the blind man trying to feel an elephant. We're just now figuring out bits and pieces of this 
disaster."

A schoolteacher said, "Usually earthquakes pass but this one went on and on. It just wouldn't 
stop, it was very, very bad."

A woman driving toward San Francisco said, "At first I thought the smoke was fog. Then I could 
see a ball of flame."

A reporter covering the World Series at Candlestick Park noted, "The upper deck was absolutely 
shaking, the light stanchions were blowing back and forth."</SUM>

The cities of Charleston, SC and San Francisco have similarities and differences when they were 
the scenes of two back-to-back disasters: Hurricane Hugo and the Bay Area earthquake. 
Charleston had warning but San Francisco did not. Charleston's neighborhoods were littered 
with debris, 80% of the buildings were damaged, and power was out. San Francisco's streets 
were passable within a day and power was restored overnight.  Charleston, however, in contrast 
to San Francisco, could quickly assess structural damage and it lost no major economic area such 
as the Bay Bridge. Both have experienced delays in disaster relief from the federal government.</SUM>
