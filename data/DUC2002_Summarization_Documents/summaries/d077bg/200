A violent earthquake registering 6.9 on the Richter scale rocked Northern California on Tuesday. 
One report said the quake was centered in the Santa Cruz area 75 miles south of San Francisco. 
Initial reports indicated widespread damage, especially affecting highways and old masonry 
buildings. A section of both The San Francisco Bridge and Oakland-San Francisco Bridge 
collapsed. World Series fans in Candlestick Park were terrified as the stands swayed. Fans were 
evacuated and there were reports of injuries. The quake shook buildings in Sacramento, 95 miles 
to the northeast and was felt 225 miles to the east at Reno, NV.

Private groups and officials from around the world and the US have offered earthquake relief. 
President Bush directed $273 million in aid. Federal and private coffers are strained by previous 
response to Hurricane Hugo. Some buildings in San Francisco collapsed because they were built 
over landfill or erected before there were earthquake codes.

The earthquake was the strongest on the San Andreas fault since the San Francisco quake of 
1906. Many scientists' studies led them to believe the next "big one" would be in Los Angles. A 
1988 US Geological Survey study predicted the area where the quake actually occurred.</SUM>
