<s docid="AP891017-0199" num="13" wdcount="37"> A violent earthquake rocked Northern 
California during Tuesday evening's rush hour, caving in a section of the San 
Francisco Bay Bridge, terrifying World Series fans in Candlestick Park and 
shaking buildings as far as 200 miles away.</s>

<s docid="AP891017-0195" num="13" wdcount="24"> The quake, which lasted about 15 seconds, measured 6.5 on the 
Richter scale, according to seismologists at the California Institute of 
Technology in Pasadena.</s> 

<s docid="AP891017-0199" num="17" wdcount="15"> It was centered near Hollister, 80 miles southeast of San Francisco in San Benito 
County.</s>  

<s docid="AP891017-0195" num="15" wdcount="21"> Televised footage of the 
bridge showed that a 30-foot section of the span's upper deck had collapsed onto 
the bottom level.</s> 

<s docid="AP891017-0199" num="14" wdcount="10"> CBS-TV reported 
one person had been killed on the bridge.</s>   

<s docid="AP891017-0199" num="15" wdcount="32"> There were no other immediate confirmed reports of deaths or 
injuries, but ABC-TV and CNN both said some people were injured at Candlestick, 
where the game was canceled and fans were evacuated.</s> 

<s docid="AP891017-0195" num="18" wdcount="7"> Buildings in San Francisco swayed several feet.</s> 

<s docid="LA102089-0172" num="36" wdcount="17"> In the city's high- towers, a few broken 
windows and other cosmetic damage could be seen.</s> 

<s docid="LA102089-0172" num="38" wdcount="12"> But most buildings, including the landmark Transamerica 
Pyramid, were not touched .</s> 

<s docid="LA102089-0172" num="23" wdcount="38">"The buildings that collapsed did so because of a combination of two things: very 
poor soil and very poor structural design," said Peter I. Yanev, chairman of EQE 
Engineering Inc., a structural engineering firm in San Francisco.</s>

<s docid="LA101889-0066" num="8" wdcount="49"> Tuesday's earthquake, the strongest on the 
San Andreas fault since the San Francisco quake on April 18, 1906, came in a 
place that had been identified by scientists just last year as the most likely 
spot for a major jolt in Northern California within the next 30 years .</s>

<s docid="AP891017-0199" num="58" wdcount="24"> The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, 
which occurred before the Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 
on the Richter scale .</s> 

<s docid="LA101889-0066" num="12" wdcount="33"> Geological 
Survey, in a 1988 report on regions of high earthquake probability in 
California, said there was a 30% chance of another 6.5-magnitude earthquake in 
the immediate vicinity by the year 2018 .</s> 

<s docid="LA101889-0066" num="13" wdcount="60"> The report cited even higher probabilities for major temblors on the 
San Andreas near Parkfield in central California and Coachella in Southern 
California in the same period, but it pinpointed the Santa Cruz mountains as the 
most vulnerable spot in Northern California, in part because the area marked the 
southernmost point of maximum ground slippage during the 1906 earthquake .</s> 

<s docid="AP891019-0037" num="35" wdcount="21"> President Bush directed $273 million 
in immediate aid for quake victims and said he would visit the area Friday or 
Saturday.</s>
