An earthquake of magnitude 7.7 hit northwestern Iran on June 21, 1990 killing at least 
50,000 people and leaving 400,000 homeless. The quake occurred when most people 
were inside asleep and hit a coastal floodplain where loosely deposited soil shifts easily 
and caused the fragile adobe homes in the area to collapse. The Iranian president 
appealed for international aid and the response was overwhelming, both from countries 
friendly to Iran's Islamic government and from those hostile. Assistance from the United 
States was the first such since the hostage crisis of 1979-80. Their respective critics 
blamed the U.S. and Iranian governments for the high death toll.</SUM>
