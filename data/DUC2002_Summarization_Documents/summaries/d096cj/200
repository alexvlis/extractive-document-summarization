The winning Super Bowl team gets the Vince Lombardi Trophy and is usually invited to 
the White House. But The Super Bowl is more than a game, it is big business. Though tax 
laws governing business entertainment were tightened in 1987, corporate ticket purchases 
are still high. Approximately 100,000 people visit the host city for a week of pre-game 
festivities, generating approximately $200 million in revenues for the community. 
Bidding for the game is increasingly competitive. In 1990, for example, the Los Angeles 
Sports Council, hoping to lure the game to Pasadena, offered the Rose Bowl rent-free for 
Super Bowl XXVII. 

Television, of course, is part of the Super Bowl equation. Both Miller Brewing Co. and 
Anheuser Bush spent over $7million on ads that aired before and during Super Bowl 
XXIV. That game, unlike the previous Super Bowl that ended in a dramatic 20-16 San 
Francisco victory over Cincinnati, was a sleeper. San Francisco routed Denver 55-10 in 
the lowest rated Super Bowl since 1969.

Frequently, the Super Bowl will highlight a community's problems. For example, a 
parade in conjunction with the 1991 Super Bowl in Tampa was cancelled after its 
sponsor, an all-white, all-male club, refused to integrate.</SUM>
