Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the Iron Lady of British politics, resigned Thursday. 
Serving for over 11 years, longer than any prime minister in the 20th Century, the 
announcement of her resignation took the world by surprise. Mrs. Thatcher was the first 
woman prime minister in Great Britain and is credited with reviving the faltering British 
economy in the early '80s. Former President Reagan had nothing but praise for Mrs. 
Thatcher. While he was still in office, the two shared a special relationship, calling each 
other Margaret and Ronnie and often appearing together at international gatherings. The 
relationship with American cooled with the coming of the Bush administration but had 
improved in recent months. Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev also had nothing but 
praise for Mrs. Thatcher and her attitude to the Soviet Union softened after her meeting 
with him. Her critics were not less vocal. Iraq rejoiced at her departure, while Argentina 
was guarded it its comments. Critics at home complained about her lack of sensitivity to 
women's issues. Queen Elizabeth II, awarded Mrs. Thatcher the Order of Merit on Friday 
while elevating her husband, Denis, to the hereditary title of baronet, dispelling rumors of 
animosity between the two women.</SUM>
