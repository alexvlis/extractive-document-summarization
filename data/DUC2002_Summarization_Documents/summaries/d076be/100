Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher resigned on Thursday after her cabinet withdrew its 
support in an upcoming vote. The move was seen as an attempt to head off a campaign by 
former defense minister Hazeltine to wrest control of the Conservative Party. The 
announcement took President Bush, and other world leaders, by surprise. Mrs. Thatcher's 
special relationship with the Reagan administration was well known. Strong willed, the 
Iron Lady, was prime minister for over 11 years, longer than any other prime minister of 
this century. While prime minister, she is credited with turning around the declining 
British economy as well as helping shape international politics.</SUM>
