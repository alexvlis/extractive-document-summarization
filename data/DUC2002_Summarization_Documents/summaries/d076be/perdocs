Former President Reagan had nothing but praise for British Prime Minster Margaret 
Thatcher on the eve of her retirement. The prime minister, dubbed the Iron Lady, 
succumbed to the challenge mounted by her former defense minister, Michael Heseltine. 
Reagan and Thatcher were staunch allies. Her support was especially valuable when Mrs. 
Thatcher was the only ally who supported the U.S. bombing of Libya and allowed U.S. 
bombers to fly from British bases. Reagan, in turn supported Mrs. Thatcher during Great 
Britain's war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands, choosing to side with one ally, 
Great Britain, against another ally, Argentina.</SUM>

British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's future will be decided today in a crucial first 
vote of Tory Members of Parliament. Should her former defense minister, Michael 
Heseltine, succeed in taking control of the part from Thatcher, she would have to give up 
the prime minister's job, a position she has held since 1979. Credited with reviving the 
British economy in the 1980s, she is now viewed as a hindrance to Britain's interests in  
the development of a strong and united Europe. In some quarters it is said that the British 
never liked Thatcher, but they respected her and voted for her as long as she delivered the 
goods.</SUM>

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's resignation on Thursday drew mixed reaction from 
world leaders. Dubbed the Iron Lady, Mrs. Thatcher drew high praise from President 
Bush and former President Reagan. Other world leaders criticized Mrs. Thatcher's 
reluctance toward increasing European unity. The harshest criticism came from 
Argentina and Iraq. Argentina criticized her position during the war over the Falkland 
Islands as extreme while Iraq, which rejoiced at her resignation, citing her position during 
the Persian Gulf Crisis as causing her downfall. Even her staunchest critics praised her 
skill and determination and her accomplishments in domestic and international politics.</SUM>

Queen Elizabeth awarded former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher the Order of Merit 
on Friday. The award follows quickly on the heels of Mrs. Thatcher's resignation as 
prime minister. The quickness of the award suggests that the Queen wished to show that 
there was no animosity between the two women. At the same time, Mrs. Thatcher's 
husband, Denis, was awarded the hereditary knighthood of baronet. He will be formally 
addressed as Sir Denis and his wife as Lady Thatcher, although she insists she wishes to 
be known simply as Mrs. Thatcher. The Order of Merit, created in 1902, is restricted to 
only 24 men and women.</SUM>

British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev 
emerged from a meeting in which they were said to have argued passionately. A Thatcher 
spokesman said the Soviet President and the Prime Minister loved arguing. Subjects 
covered in the meeting ranged from nuclear disarmament to the sale of Soviet bombers to 
Libya. When Thatcher asked Gorbachev about the sale, the Soviet President did not 
respond. Thatcher expressed doubts on the Soviet statement about the Soviet's chemical 
arsenal and disagreed with Gorbachev's position that nuclear weapons should be 
eliminated from Europe. Mrs. Thatcher believes that the presence of nuclear weapons 
deters war.</SUM>

Margaret Thatcher barely survived a vote of confidence by her party colleagues in the 
House of Commons. The narrow margin of her victory over former defense minister 
Michael Heseltine means Thatcher will face a second round of voting on Thursday. Mrs. 
Thatcher has served longer than any other prime minister in this century, steering her 
country through a war with Argentina and reversing Britain's economic decline. Even so, 
after 11.5 years, the negative aspects of Mrs. Thatcher's tenure are likely to overshadow 
her accomplishments and her re-election is hardly assured as polls indicate the Tories 
would do better without her in the next election.</SUM>

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was criticized or speculating on her political future. In 
an interview with the Sunday Correspondent, Mrs. Thatcher said she hoped to lead her 
Conservative Party to a fourth successive election but that she doubted that she would try 
for a fifth. The admission has weakened her position according to her political opponents. 
The Sunday Times of London called the admission a colossal blunder. Mrs. Thatcher has 
served longer than any other prime minister of the 20th Century. If the Conservatives win 
the next election, Mrs. Thatcher is expected to step down before the end of her term, 
paving the ay for her successor.</SUM>

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, considered America's best friend for almost a decade, 
has decided to retire. President Bush called her an outstanding ally of the United States. 
Her closest ties, however, were with former President Reagan.. They were ideological 
soul mates who were usually side by side at international gatherings. Calling each other 
Ronnie and Margaret, they shared similar political and economic views. During the 
British clash with Argentina, the United States was forced to choose between two allies. 
President Bush was more experienced in world politics and knew many world leaders and 
Mrs. Thatcher became just one of the gang.</SUM>

Margaret Thatcher broke the mold in English politics when she became that country's 
first woman Prime Minister. Even so, critics say she did little to advance the cause of 
women. No believer in feminism, Mrs. Thatcher believed the battle for women's rights 
had been won. Women occupy 43 percent of the British workforce yet they generally are 
paid less and are poorly represented in managerial jobs and parliament. Supporters point 
to Mrs. Thatcher's legislation on work place nurseries and independent taxation for 
working women. As prime minister, she angered feminists by emphasizing women's 
roles as homemakers and care givers.</SUM>

Prime Minister Thatcher's resignation took President Bush by surprise. Thatcher had told 
the world that she would fight to a second ballot. However, after being told Wednesday 
evening by her own cabinet officers that they could not support her in the second ballot 
process, the decision to retire was her only option. If someone was to beat Heseltine, it 
wouldn't be Margaret Thatcher.  Mrs. Thatcher was a strong supporter of shared Anglo-
American values. Although she shared a special relationship with former President 
Reagan, relations with President Bush were cool at first, warming gradually as the two 
found common ground.</SUM>
