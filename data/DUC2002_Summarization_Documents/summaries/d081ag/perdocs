An estimated 200,000 black gold and coal miners in South Africa are expected to begin a strike 
for higher wages and better working conditions. It would be the largest job action ever to affect 
the mining industry in that nation.  If other mines join in, a total of 300,000 miners could be on 
strike.  Gold and coal account for more than half of South Africa's foreign-currency holdings.

The union is demanding a 30% across-the-board wage increase for black miners who it says earn 
an average of $109 a month.  The Chamber of Mines says they earn twice that much.</SUM>

More than 4,000 workers at the Manifest Lipcowy coalmine in Jastrzebie southwest of Warsaw 
went on strike today to demand legalization of Solidarity and higher wages.  Solidarity was 
formed around Gdansk eight years before when factory and shipyard workers united to form the 
only independent trade federation in the Soviet bloc.  It was crushed in 1981.

Manifest Lipcowy is the second mine in the industrial region of Silesia to experience unrest.  
Workers at the Rudna copper mine near Wroclaw staged a protest rally Monday to demand 
improved safety conditions and the return to work of Solidarity activists barred Saturday from 
working.</SUM>

More than 10,000 coal miners in West Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Kentucky 
were off the job today to express sympathy for miners in Virginia and West Virginia.  The 
Indiana walkout was prompted by a Thursday CBS telecast which focused on the Pittston strike.  
Pittston dropped out of the Bituminous Coal Operator's Association to negotiate with the United 
Mine Workers independently.  There has been no agreement in 16 months.

United Mine Workers officials gave conflicting indications of whether they are responsible for 
the wildcat strike.  Coal companies contend the walkouts at companies other than Pittston violate 
a no-strike clause.</SUM>

Strikes in the Soviet Union by thousands of coal miners and other workers have shut down more 
than 200 mines and factories in the country's two top coal-producing regions: the Donetsk region 
of the Ukraine and Siberia's Kuzretsk Basin.  The miners are demanding more local control over 
their industry, higher wages, and better living conditions.

Government negotiations have resolved most of the demands, including those on pensions and 
overtime, but some longer-term questions will take up to a month to settle and miners are 
refusing any delay.  A law on ending strikes and labor conflicts is being rushed through the 
Supreme Soviet.</SUM>

Strikes by thousands of miners spread from the Siberian region to Vorkuta in the far north, 
Rostov in southwestern Russia, Dnepropetrovsk in the Ukraine and Karaganda in Soviet Central 
Asia.  The miners are seeking greater local control over their industries and better wages and 
living conditions.  The strikes are the country's worse since the 1920s.

The government has acknowledged that conditions for the miners are abysmal and has made 
general pledges of improvement.  President Gorbachev said the strikes could imperil his reforms. 
He said we may have to take such extreme measures that it will hurt what we've been doing.</SUM>

Coal miners in Siberia ended their strike today after exacting promises of better food, housing 
and working conditions.  Despite announcements that President Gorbachev's concessions--
including granting miners greater control of their industry--apply nationwide, hundreds of 
thousands of miners stayed off work elsewhere.  Strikes continued in the Donetsk Coal Basin and 
Chervonograd in the Ukraine, the Karaganda region of Kazakhstan, and the Pechora Basin in 
Russia.

Coal Minister Mikhail Shchadov said the government agreed to make all Soviet coal operations

A one-day coal miners' strike in Kazakhstan and the Ukraine has spread to all of the country's 
major coal regions.  It is the new union's first major test of strength.  The larger 1989 strike 
made only economic demands.

The government has not kept promises to raise miners' living standards and this time they also 
want three major political concessions.  First, "real sovereignty" for the 15 Soviet Republics; 
second, more power for the Federation Council which includes republic presidents; and finally, 
they want a "low on property" defining what belongs to the government and allow private 
ownership of land and industry, including some mines.</SUM>

Miners in the northern Vorkuta region are expanding their strike and blocking coal shipments,

Coal miners in northern Ukraine struck for two weeks this summer but returned to work after a

Workers at KGHM in Lubin, Poland's copper producing combine went on strike yesterday as 
coal-mining unions staged token stoppages in a third of the country's pits in a major challenge to 
the government's economic policies.  The KGHM strike came despite a management offer to 
increase wages by 20%.  Coal mining unions are also demanding wage increases as well as a 
clear restructuring strategy for their industry.

The copper industry continues to show profit but coal mining is running at a loss.  This has led to 
temporary lay-offs, which hit miners' incomes and led to the present bout of unrest.</SUM>

Coal miners from Romania's Jiu Valley who led anti-reform rampages through Bucharest in 
1990 and 1991 are again on strike. The government has not caved in and has begun legal action 
to have the strike declared illegal.  The miners' position seems untenable. Romanians are 
opposed to the miners' wage demand, the mines are not considered a vital source of energy, and 
the miners are in danger of pricing their coal out of the market.

The miners want more money to compensate for difficult living and working conditions.  They 
also are following Miron Cosma, their charismatic leader who secured their earlier wage 
increases.</SUM>

In Yenakiyevo in the Donetsk Oblast, miners at six coal production association and pits went on 
strike demanding payment of wage arrears.  A miners' rally was held near the town council 
building. A strike committee was elected which decided to continue the strike until demands 
were fulfilled.

Shift workers of a mine in Ugledar refused to work for the same reason. The mine's director 
promised to pay the arrears. Shift workers at two mines in Pervomaysk, Lugansk Oblast, refused 
to start work for political reasons--to compromise the existing authorities, particularly President 
Leonid Kravchuk, before the second round of political elections.</SUM>
