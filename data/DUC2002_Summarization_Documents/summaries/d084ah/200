An explosion in the battleship Iowa's No.2 turret on Wednesday, April 19, 1989, during a 
training exercise NE of Puerto Rico, killed 47. Naval investigators concluded the 
explosion occurred while gunpowder was in transit from a powder hoist. Crew in upper 
turret chambers died instantly in the explosion and fire while those at lower levels 
suffocated as the blast sucked out oxygen. Eleven escaped from powder magazines at the 
turret's base. 

On Sunday, 3000 family and friends welcomed the Iowa home to Norfolk. Sailors with 
black arm bands lined the Iowa's rails and two surviving guncrew members stood on the 
blackened No.2 turret. On Monday, President Bush spoke to 8000 mourners at a 
memorial service and Iowa commander Capt. Fred Moosally praised the victims. 

A moratorium was placed on firing the 16-inch guns, which are criticized as outdated 
and dangerous, using gunpowder packed in silk bags that are rammed into a gun after the 
shell and ignited by electric spark. Newer guns' powder is packed in metal containers. 
Missiles have integrated propellants. The four WWII-era battleships came out of 
mothballs in 1982. Critics say they have outlived their purpose but the Navy disagrees 
and is keeping them in service. The Senate Armed Services Committee will hold hearings 
on the explosion.</SUM>
