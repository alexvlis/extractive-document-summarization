Hurricane Gilbert was the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the western 
hemisphere.  This Category 5 storm, with sustained winds exceeding 155 mph and gusts 
clocked at 175 mph, had the lowest barometric pressure ever recorded at 26.13 inches.  
Massive in size, it had storm winds extending 250 miles north and 200 miles south of its 
eye.  For one hellish week in mid-September, 1988, it roared through the Caribbean, 
slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula, and then moved back over water before finally 
losing its punch at its second landfall at the Texas-Mexican border.  In spite of officials' 
warnings and both voluntary and forced evacuations from coastal areas, it left a trail of 
death and destruction in its wake.  At least 109 people died; damage is estimated at $8 
billion.  Hundreds of thousands are homeless.  Many survivors are still without food, 
drinking water and electricity.  The storm caused damage in Haiti, Cuba and the 
Dominican Republic, but the most severe damage was in Jamaica, where 100,000 of the 
country's 500,000 homes were destroyed, and then the Yucatan Peninsula where the 
resort areas of Cancun and Cozumel were hit hard.  The limited damage in Texas was 
caused primarily by flooding and by hurricane spawned tornadoes.</SUM>
