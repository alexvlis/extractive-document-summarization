Dog shows throughout the world bring together hundreds if not thousands of contestants 
representing the world's 135 dog breeds.  Publicity stunts, professional handlers, 
sometimes the courts and possibly even violence may be involved.  Awards and glory 
await the champions.  Occasionally, some dogs manage to gain fame outside of the dog 
show scene.</SUM>
