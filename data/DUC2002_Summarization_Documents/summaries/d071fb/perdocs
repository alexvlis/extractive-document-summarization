The Dog Fanciers Club organized a lunch at Sardi's on Wednesday for two of their 
champions, the city's top police dog and the nation's top show dog.  Nero, a big, amiable 
bruiser of a German Shepard specializes in sniffing out bombs and narcotics.  He has 
helped in hundreds of arrests and "apprehended" more than 50 felons.  Great Elms Prince 
Charming II is a fluffy little Pomeranian.  He was named best in show at the prestigious 
Westminister Kennel Club Show in Madison Square Garden last month.  Unfairly, 
neither Nero nor Prince got any lunch at this prominent midtown restaurant.</SUM>

Marco, a feisty boxer, walked off with the champion's trophy at Israel's dog-of-the-year 
contest held in Tel Aviv's Exhibition Center.  This sanctioned, two-day international 
event gave about 20,000 people the opportunity to see about 800 pretty pouches of more 
than 50 breeds.  However, organizers conceded there were few if any contestants from 
abroad.  The "intefadeh", the word used to describe the 9-month-old wave of Palestinian 
violence in Israel, may have drastically reduced this year's foreign competition as 
compared with a similar show last year.  Still, for dog lovers, the show briefly pushed 
Israel's general elections out of the limelight.</SUM>

One of the three owners of Cory, a champion German short-haired pointer is suing the 
other two for damages and to determine if Cory is officially retired.  Cory has won 245 
shows as Best-of-Breed and 19 awards as Best-in-Show.  Plaintiff Attalla claims the 
owners' agreement specifies that he advances fees to show the dog and he decides when 
Cory retires.  He is suing the other two owners, John and Rita Remondi for $125,000 in 
fees and to stop them from showing Cory, who has been officially retired as announced in 
Dog News.  The Remondis claim that Cory's retirement is fraudulent.</SUM>

Bill McFadden, a 32-year-old professional dog handler, knows that the secret to 
producing champions is just plain, hard work.  Bill, assisted by his wife Taffe, puts in 18 
hour days grooming and conditioning his charges, and then crisscrosses the country 
showing them for their owners.  McFadden handles an average of 20 to 25 dogs at each 
show and works around 120 shows a year throughout the U.S.  "We finish with close to 
100 champions a year," he said.  McFadden's latest product, a Kerry blue terrier named 
Kerrageen's Hotspur with 37 Best in Show wins, is the top in his breed of all time.</SUM>

William Wegman is a professional photographer known for hilarious portraits of his 
weimaraner dogs.  They are good companions for an artist.  They are affectionate, do not 
drool and they have style.  His current weimaraners, Fay Ray and Battina, are like world-
famous fashion models--they are lean and supple.  William's relationship with them is 
unusually tender.  It is easy to see how he can get them to slip into florid housedresses or 
scratch each other's backs.  William's first world famous dog, Man Ray, died in 1985.  
Fay Ray is now familiar to artists and among children who watch "Sesame Street".</SUM>
