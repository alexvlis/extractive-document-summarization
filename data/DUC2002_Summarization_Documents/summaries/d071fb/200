At dog shows throughout the world, proud owners compete their charges for the awards 
and glory that await the champions.  Prince, a fluffy, little Pomeranian, after winning at 
the prestigious Westminster Kennel Club Show in Madison Square Garden was honored 
at a lunch held at a Sardi's, a prominent New York City restaurant.  However, not all 
"famous" dogs are show dogs.  Sharing the limelight at Sardi's was Nero, New York 
City's top police dog.  Nero helped the police make hundreds of arrests and apprehend 
more than 50 felons.  And one need only look at the renown attained by photographer 
William Wegman's Weimaraners.  Artists worldwide know his dogs, as do children who 
watch "Sesame Street".  But it's the show dogs that crisscross the country to strut their 
stuff, sometimes as many as the 2,500 dogs representing 138 breeds that competed at the 
All Breed Dog Show and Obedience trials in Los Angeles.  Some may possibly go to Tel 
Aviv, Israel for its annual show.  Bill McFadden, a professional dog handler, works about 
120 shows a year throughout the U.S., showing 20 to 25 dogs at each show.  Among 
those he shows is Kerrageen's Hotspur, the top award winning Kerry blue terrier of all 
time.</SUM>
