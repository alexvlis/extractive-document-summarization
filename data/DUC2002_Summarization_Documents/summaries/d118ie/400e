<s docid="AP890309-0143" num="11" wdcount="29"> The Democratic-controlled

<s docid="AP890309-0143" num="13" wdcount="33"> It was only the ninth time in

<s docid="AP890211-0110" num="12" wdcount="44"> The Senate Armed Services 
Committee has put the nomination of Tower, a former Texas senator and 
onetime chairman of the committee, on hold while it takes a second look

<s docid="LA021189-0003" num="20" wdcount="52"> Lawmakers from both parties 
have said they are concerned that there would be a continuing 
appearance of conflict of interest hanging over Tower because of his

1/2 years -- not including the more than $200,000 British Aerospace 
paid him .</s>

<s docid="AP890316-0012" num="36" wdcount="23"> Tower not only shunned

get the job for a six-month trial and then return for reconfirmation, a 
gimmick that would have changed the system and could have haunted the 
presidency.</s>
