Former Texas Senator John Tower was killed in a commuter plane crash on Sea Island, off the 
coast of Georgia. The crash, which killed everyone on board, also took the life of his daughter, 
Marian. Tower was recently the center of controversy when his nomination for Secretary of 
Defense was rejected by the Senate Armed Forces Committee and the full Senate. Tower became 
only the ninth nominee in history to be rejected. He also was the first nominee ever to be rejected 
so early in the term of a new presidency. Tower's rejection followed allegations of problems with 
alcohol. Tower admitted that he had been a heavy drinker in the 70s but that he has since limited 
his drinking to a glass of wine with dinner. Tower, twice divorced, also was accused of 
inappropriate behavior towards women. The Senate Armed Services Committee also called into 
question his contradictory testimony on his dealings with defense contractors. Tower told the 
committee that his advice to British Aerospace was limited to civil aviation matters while in a 
1987 deposition written for his second divorce, he said he advised the company on selling certain 
systems to the defense department.</SUM>
