The tributes to the musical genius, Leonard Bernstein, who died on October 14th at 72 
from lung failure, continue. Thursday, a capacity audience filled the Broadway's Majestic 
Theater to hear recollections about the man who etched an indelible niche in American 
popular culture with his composition for West Side Story and to listen to classic 
Bernstein songs. 

Four days after his death, the New York Philharmonic, in tribute to the internationally 
acclaimed maestro who directed it from 1958 to 1969, replaced its regular program with 
an emotional all Bernstein program. The Los Angeles Philharmonic and the American 
Youth Orchestra also remembered him with special selections in their programs the 
weekend after his death. After his death, radio stations featured his work and a special 
section ran in the New York Times for public condolences. Several record companies 
announced accelerated programs to re-releases Bernstein recordings

A brilliant conductor, pianist, composer and teacher, Bernstein had canceled public 
appearances with increasing frequency. He did, however, appear at two 70th birthday 
celebrations. The first, a four-day event at Tanglewood, was a benefit for the music 
center. The other, at Carnegie Hall was held on the 45th anniversary of his directorial 
debut with the New York Philharmonic.</SUM>
