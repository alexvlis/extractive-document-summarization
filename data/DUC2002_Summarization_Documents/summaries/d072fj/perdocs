I remember the Rennaissance man of music, Leonard Bernstein, from October 1948. I 
was an American volunteer in the Israeli army. Once, courtesy of the Israeli equivalent to 
the USO, I attended a performance of the Israel Philharmonic when Bernstein was guest 
conductor.

Black-tie patrons and soldiers in fatigues comprised the audience. The program included 
Beethoven's emotional Fifth Symphony. Intermittently for most of the symphony, we 
could hear machine-gun fire from the Jordanian Legion held sector. The crackling sound 
melded with the music and seemed entirely appropriate to the mood and circumstances. 
Lenny and the orchestra never missed a beat.</SUM>

Seventy-two-year-old maestro, Leonard Bernstein, suffering from emphysema, a lung 
tumor and pulmonary infections, will retire from conducting and performing on the 
piano. He will, however, continue to compose and write and plans to complete a chamber 
music piece, a musical, and his memoirs.

Possibly Bernstein will participate in an AIDS benefit at Carnegie Hall on Oct. 28, but 
other appearances have been canceled.

Bernstein published his first composition in 1942 and conducted his first symphony in 
1944. From 1958 to 1969, he directed the New York Philharmonic. In 1969, he became 
the Philharmonic's laureate conductor for life.</SUM>

Leonard Bernstein, exhausted and suffering from the effects of several lung ailments, 
canceled performances with the London Symphony Orchestra in Japan. He will return to 
the United States to recover.

Mr. Bernstein, 71, issued an apology and said that Michael Thomas, LSO principal 
conductor, and Japanese conductor Eiji Oue were asked to fulfill his responsibilities. 

Mr. Bernstein also canceled appearances with an orchestra of young musicians who had 
been training under LSO principals during the Pacific Music Festival in Japan. 
Inaugurated by Bernstein last month, it is probably the first Asian festival where young 
musicians can train with a professional orchestra.</SUM>

During his 47-year association with the Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra, Leonard 
Bernstein led 1244 concerts. Tonight the Philharmonic commemorated their laureate 
conductor who died four days ago at age 72. Leonard Slatkin directed an extraordinary all 
Bernstein program. The somber mood in the hall was initially broken by the overture to 
"Candide" (1956) and  "Serenade for Solo Violin, String Orchestra, Harp and 
Percussion" (1954). The mourning returned, however, with "Jeremiah" (1942). During it, 
mezzo-soprano Wendy White, as well as audience members, shed tears.  The final selection, 
"Chichester Psalms" (1965) ended with a chorus declaring a message Bernstein sought 
for society: "Together in unity."</SUM>

composer, conductor and teacher died Sunday in his Manhattan apartment. He was 72 
and had suffered from progressive lung failure. 

Mr. Bernstein, the internationally acclaimed conductor of the New York Philharmonic 
from 1957 until 1968, was the first American-born conductor to lead a major symphony 
orchestra. Harvard educated and mentored by several musical giants, including Aaron 
Copeland, he brought classical music to the masses via his innovative television series

Leonard Bernstein, 70, returned to Carnegie Hall with the New York Philharmonic 
Monday, 45 years after his triumphant debut with the orchestra. Three Bernstein 
compositions, all played stunningly, formed the program. At intermission, Mrs. Arthur 
Rodzinski, widow of the  Philharmonic music director who hired Bernstein as his 
assistant in 1943, was introduced. Violinist Jacques Margolies, who played in that first 
concert, is still a member of the orchestra and played Monday night. Eight others who 
were members in 1943 went on stage. 

Bernstein, in his 1,215th appearance as Philharmonic conductor, received a silver box 
engraved with a reproduction of Monday evening's program.</SUM>
