Hurricane Gilbert has cut a destructive swath through the Caribbean.  The third hurricane 
of 1988 buffeted the southern coasts of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Dominican 
Republic, Haiti and Cuba.  Five were killed in the Dominican Republic.  On Monday, the 
storm hit Jamaica with its full force, killing 19 and causing extensive damage.  
Wednesday, Gilbert hit the resorts of Cancun and Cozumel on Mexico's Yucatan 
peninsula with winds of 160 mph, causing extensive damage.  Gilbert then headed for the 
Gulf of Mexico.  Forecasters remain baffled by why Gilbert became such an intense 
storm, attaining the lowest barometric pressure ever recorded.</SUM>
