Since September 10, Hurricane Gilbert has cut a destructive path through the Caribbean, 
hitting Jamaica and the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico with its full force.  Gilbert became 
the third hurricane of the 1988 season on Saturday.  On Sunday, it passed south of the 
Greater Antilles, causing flooding, power outages, and airport closures, and knocking 
down trees and tearing off roofs in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Dominican 
Republic, Haiti and Cuba.  In the Dominican Republic, five were killed and 10 inches of 
rain fell.  The eye of the storm hit Kingston, Jamaica, on Monday, then moved lengthwise 
across the island, at about 17 mph with sustained winds of 155 mph, causing extensive 
damage.  Nineteen were killed in Jamaica.  The storm buffeted the Cayman Islands, then 
struck the resorts of Cancun and Cozumel on the Yucatan with winds of 160 mph.  Power 
and communications were cut, flooding was extensive, and bands of youths began looting 
in Cancun.  By midnight, Gilbert was northeast of the Yucatan and heading for the Gulf 
of Mexico.  Gilbert was an extremely intense storm, attaining the lowest barometric 
pressure ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere.  Forecasters remain baffled by why 
this trough became such a ferocious storm.</SUM>
