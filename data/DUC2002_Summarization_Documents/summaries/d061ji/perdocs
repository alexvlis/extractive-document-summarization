Hurricane Gilbert is moving toward the Dominican Republic, where the residents of the 
south coast, especially the Barahona Province, have been alerted to prepare for heavy 
rains, and high winds and seas.  Tropical Storm Gilbert formed in the eastern Caribbean 
and became a hurricane on Saturday night.  By 2 a.m. Sunday it was about 200 miles 
southeast of Santo Domingo and moving westward at 15 mph with winds of 75 mph.  
Flooding is expected in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.  The second hurricane of the 
season, Florence, is now over the southern United States and downgraded to a tropical 
storm.</SUM>

Hurricane Gilbert hit Jamaica today with 110 mph winds and torrential rain, causing 
serious damage in Kingston overnight.  The storm center is expected to hit land at 
Clarendon parish, then move lengthwise across the island.  The government is preparing 
for the worst with government agencies on alert and coastal residents directed to move to 
higher ground.  Communications have already been affected.  Gilbert, described as one of 
the larger systems, has already caused some damage in Puerto Rico, the Dominican 
Republic, Haiti, and Cuba.  Fears are high on the Cayman Islands, the next target on its 
track.</SUM>

Hurricane Gilbert's growth baffles forecasters.  On 3 September it was a dry low-pressure 
trough--one of 50-60 a year--west of Africa.  By Tuesday night it was an intense storm 
with the lowest barometric pressure--26.13 inches--ever recorded.  Why did Gilbert 
strengthened and others not?  Scientists do know that budding storms need to be off the 
equator and are fueled by winds converging where there is high moisture in the lower 
atmosphere.  Clouds may form and the air mass starts spinning, moving heat to the upper 
atmosphere.  The warm September waters in the Caribbean can cause the storm to 
explode.</SUM>
