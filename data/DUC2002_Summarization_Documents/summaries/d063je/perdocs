An explosion at the southern England town of Deal leveled a two-story barracks at the 
Royal Marines School of Music and seriously damaged many homes in the 
neighborhood. The band was playing at the time of the explosion and was trapped under 
the wreckage.  The blast, an act of the Irish Republican Army, left 11 dead and 22

An explosion at the Royal Marines School of Music in the southeastern coastal town of 
Deal killed eight people and injured 30. Up to 18 people were feared trapped in the 
rubble. The reason for the blast, which occurred at 8:26 a.m. in a lounge in the barracks is 
not known but a forensic team from Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad had been called 
in to help investigate. The injured are suffering from injuries typical of an explosion. In 
recent years, military targets on the British mainland have been attacked by the Irish 
Republican Army as it seeks to rid Northern Ireland of British rule.</SUM>

The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for an explosion, which leveled a 
military barracks and damaged nearby homes and left 11 people dead and 22 injured. The 
barracks was part of the Royal Marines School of Music, the training center for young 
recruits wanting to play in the seven Royal Marine bands. Rescue workers with heavy 
equipment and thermal cameras searched the rubble for casualties. The explosion follows 
on the heels of Prime Minister Thatcher's visit to Northern Ireland. This is the latest in a 
series of attacks on the British mainland. In February, soldiers had just evacuated their 
barracks before a bomb exploded.</SUM>

Family members who lost sons to the IRA terrorist attack at the Royal Marines Music 
School joined local residents and opposition politicians in condemning the security 
arrangements at the academy. The use of private security firms to protect the school and 
other military establishments in Britain was denounced as inadequate. Three men with 
Irish accents who rented a house near the school just prior to the attack are being sought 
for questioning. The blast killed 10 and injured 22, 12 seriously, during a coffee break 
from morning practices.  The attack on Friday was the worst since an attack in central 
London in 1982, which left 11 dead.</SUM>

Britons expressed anger and concern over the lax security procedures at British bases 
following the Friday IRA bombing at the Royal Marines Music School in Deal. That 
attack left 10 dead and 22 injured, 12 seriously.  The Royal Marines Music School is one 
of 30 bases in England employing private security firms. Considered a money saving 
measure, there were calls to review the policy. Because of the tighter security at bases 
considered to be at high risk, the IRA has turned its attention to bases they consider more 
vulnerable. The attack came after Prime Minister Thatcher's speech in Ulster, praising 
the Ulster Defense Regiment.</SUM>

In what they said was a response to Prime Minister Thatcher's "declaration of war" in a 
speech to the Ulster Defense Force, the Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for 
an explosion which leveled a three-story barracks in Deal, killing 10 and injuring 22. The 
barracks, which belonged to the Royal Marines Music School, was the latest in a series of 
IRA bombings of military facilities. Security forces believe at least two IRA "active 
service units" are operating in Britain and Europe. Two members of these groups, Patrick 
Sheehy, known as the Jackal, and John Conaghty are being sought in connection with 
earlier attacks.</SUM>

was condemned as "senseless" by Prince Phillip. The prince, husband of Queen Elizabeth 
II and captain general of the Royal Marines made these remarks during a visit to the

there were calls by the clergy for the people to help break the cycle of violence and
