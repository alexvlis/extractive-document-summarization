President Bush picked former senator John Tower of Texas to be Secretary of
Defense.  His choice was popular with Senate Republicans and he was expected
to win easy confirmation.  However, questions arose regarding Tower=B9s moral
character, heavy drinking, womanizing and lucrative dealings with defense
contractors.  Tower said earlier problems with alcohol were behind him, but
there were indications that they still existed. The Democratic controlled
Armed Services Committee voted 11-9 against recommending Tower. The full
Senate rejected Tower 53-47 with one Republican voting against him and three
Democrats for him.   John Tower and his daughter were killed in a plane
crash in 1991.</SUM>
