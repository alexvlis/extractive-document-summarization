Exotic Kashmir has become a war zone where Moslem separatists are seeking 
independence from predominately Hindu India.  At least 72 people have been killed since 
the first of the year.  The 24-hour curfew in Srinagar was lifted briefly on Monday so 
people could shop.  Electricity was turned off on Friday, the Moslem Sabbath, to silence 
the mosques' loudspeakers.  The governor of Jammu-Kashmir claims only a "handful of 
terrorists" are fighting, but others say the situation is critical.  Kashmir, predominately 
Moslem, was divided between India and Moslem Pakistan in 1947.  India claims Pakistan 
is training and arming the separatists; Pakistan denies this.</SUM>
