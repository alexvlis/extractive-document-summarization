Physicist Andrei D. Sakharov became the youngest member of the Soviet Academy of 
Sciences and helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb, but urged limiting its production 
and testing. He was a prominent 1970s dissident and won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize. In 
January 1980, after Sakharov criticized Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, Breshnev 
exiled him to Gorky. Gorbachev allowed Sakharov and his wife Yelena Bonner to return 
to Moscow in December 1986. There they lived simply in a two-room, seventh-floor 
apartment which became a mecca for Soviets seeking aid. Sakharov supported 
Gorbachev's reforms but called for speedier progress in human rights, political prisoner 
liberation, and a nuclear testing ban. In November 1988 he visited the US, underwent 
medical tests, and promoted a world peace foundation. In April 1989, he was elected to 
parliament after Soviet physicists voted secretly to nominate him. He warned of national 
economic catastrophe. Sakharov died alone in his Moscow apartment in December 1989 
at the age of 68, of an apparent heart attack, hours after urging creation of an opposition 
party. World and Soviet leaders and press eulogized him as a sincere man who suffered 
great injustice and helped change Soviet society. 45,000 grievers filed past Sakharov's 
body. Sakharov had four children and four grandchildren.</SUM>
