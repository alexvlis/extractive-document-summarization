The shuttle Discovery is to lift off from Kennedy Space Center at 8:31am EDT Tuesday 
with five astronauts and the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope. A faulty power unit  
forced cancellation of an April 10th launch. NASA must launch Discovery by Saturday 
or wait eight days to recharge Hubble's batteries. Later, shuttle Columbia will take up 
astronomical observatory Astro to measure ultraviolet radiation and provide Hubble with 
additional targets. Hubble and Astro launches were scheduled for 1986 but delayed by the 
Challenger accident. Discovery will aim for an altitude of 380 miles, the highest a shuttle 
has ever gone, to place Hubble in orbit above Earth's distorting atmosphere.</SUM>

Countdown clocks resumed ticking at 3pm Saturday for the shuttle Discovery's delayed 
launch at 5:31am PDT Tuesday, 14 days after a take-off was canceled because of a faulty 
hydraulic power steering unit. A replacement steering unit was successfully tested.   
Discovery  will boost the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope into orbit. Hubble's 
battery charging was finished Thursday. Discovery's five-member crew--Commander 
Loren Shriver, co-pilot Charles Bolden, Steven Hawley, Bruce McCandless, and Kathryn 
Sullivan--plan to launch Hubble Wednesday. Shuttle Columbia was also readied, for a 
May 16th Spacelab astronomy mission. Two shuttles have not been on NASA's launch 
pads simultaneously since the 1986 Challenger launch.</SUM>

Shuttle Discovery is to launch from Kennedy Space Center at 8:31am EDT today, climb 
a record 380 miles, and place the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit. Above Earth's 
distorting atmosphere, Hubble can provide many times better resolution and sensitivity 
than ground-based observatories. Scientists can study galaxies 14 billion light years 
away. Tomorrow, Discovery's mechanical arm will lift out the 24,250-lb. telescope, with 
spacewalkers assisting if necessary. Discovery will follow Hubble until its lens cap 
opens. Next month shuttle Columbia will launch, carrying the Astro observatory. Hubble 
cost $1.5 billion, with spare parts, training, and software $500 million more, and 
maintenance in space $200 million yearly for 15 years.</SUM>

Five hours after shuttle Discovery's launch Tuesday carrying the Hubble Space 
Telescope, delayed since 1983, Hubble sent its first signal. Hubble is hailed as the 
greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo. In its 15 years orbiting 380 miles above 
Earth, its two cameras, two spectrometers, photometer, fine-pointing system, and 94.5- 
and 12-inch mirrors can look 14 billion years backward in time. Tomorrow, Discovery's 
mechanical arm will lift the 12-ton, 43-foot long, 14-foot wide Hubble out of the cargo 
bay. Batteries will power Hubble until wing-like solar panels extend, with manual help if 
necessary. The $1.5 billion telescope cost $7 million a month to maintain on Earth.</SUM>

Tuesday the shuttle Discovery launched a new era in space exploration. It carries the $1.5 
billion Hubble Space Telescope, 10 times sharper than the largest Earth telescopes. 
Crucial steps are a robotic arm lifting Hubble from the cargo bay and Hubble's solar 
arrays unfurling. Discovery will follow for two days to assist if anything goes wrong. A 
seven-month checkout period will follow. The first photograph, in a week, will be an 
exercise and probably fuzzy.  After delays since 1983, technical problems postponed an 
April 10th launch. Many involved spectators could not return Tuesday. All five crew 
members are veterans of previous flights. AF Col. Loren Shriver is the commander.</SUM>

At 3:38pm EDT Wednesday, Steven Hawley released the Hubble Space Telescope from  
shuttle Discovery's mechanical arm. Starboard solar wing unfurling took three tries and 
caused a delay. The 12-ton Hubble drifted into its orbit 380 miles above Earth. Hubble's 
94.5-inch mirror is to be exposed to starlight Friday, after Hubble's maneuverability is 
tested to ensure the mirror can stay pointed away from the sun. Discovery is following 
Hubble so spacewalkers Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan can assist if the 10-foot 
aperture door doesn't open properly. Hubble's first transmitted image, of a star cluster in 
constellation Carina, is expected Tuesday. Technical delays and the Challenger explosion 
delayed Hubble's launch since 1983.</SUM>

Discovery astronauts launched the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope on its 97.3-
minute, 380-mile-high orbit around Earth at 12:38pm PDT today, one orbit late. Steve 
Hawley began the slow process of grasping the 12.5-ton Hubble with Discovery's 50-foot 
mechanical arm shortly after 4am PDT. First he had to disconnect Hubble from the 
shuttle's power and switch it to batteries. The first solar array unreeled properly.  The 
starboard panel first refused to budge, then moved a fifth of its 39-foot length. 
Commands from Earth finally freed it. Sun power flowing into the telescope's batteries 
through solar panels relieved worries that the batteries would use up their eight-hour 
charge.</SUM>

On Wednesday, Discovery's robot arm grasped the $1.5 billion, 12-ton Hubble Space
Telescope, NASA's most expensive unmanned spacecraft, and hoisted 
it into space. After  problems in unfurling a solar panel array were overcome, Discovery 
backed away and parked in orbit 46 miles behind. For six hours, ground controllers tried 
to make contact with Hubble's two high-gain antennas, finally doing so by nearly 
doubling the antenna's beam width, to 10.8 degrees. The problem was incorrect pointing 
of either Hubble or the TDRS, an orbiting communications satellite. Today the telescope 
will be tested for  maneuverability before the aperture door is opened Friday to expose 
the mirror to starlight.</SUM>

The shuttle that put the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit carried the eyepiece from 
Mount Wilson Observatory's 100-inch Hooker Telescope, constructed in 1918. It was the 
world's most powerful telescope until 1948, when the 200-inch Hale Telescope went into 
operation at Mount Palomar Observatory. Astronomer Edwin Hubble used the Hooker in 
the 1920s and 1930s to take thousands of photographs of faint galaxies. He provided the 
first definite proof that other galaxies existed and observational evidence for Einstein's 
theory that the universe was expanding. He helped convince scientists the universe was 
created in a giant explosion 15 billion years ago. The Hooker Telescope was mothballed 
in 1985.</SUM>

This morning controllers took the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope out of safe mode, 
in which its own computers and sensors guide its operation in case contact is lost. After 
communications outages, controllers are taking things slowly. Recorded telemetry signals 
will be played to Earth when high-speed dish antennas are working properly. Systems set 
at conservative limits are causing malfunctions. The motion of Hubble's aperture door 
opening Friday, exposing the 94.5-inch eye, knocked out two of four position-stabilizing 
gyroscopes. Engineers got them working again. After Hubble's deployment Wednesday, 
Discovery stayed close in case of trouble but plans to return to Earth Sunday. Problems 
have put Hubble's schedule several days behind.</SUM>
