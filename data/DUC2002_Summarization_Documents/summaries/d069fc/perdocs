Emerging opposition to uncompromising rule in East Germany has raised questions about 
their leaders' ability to resist the democratic reforms sweeping through Eastern bloc 
countries. A mass emigration of disaffected East Germans has rekindled reunification talk 
in West Germany. Close to 80,000 East German refugees have arrived in West Germany 
so far this year. Moscow has tolerated reforms elsewhere, but is more concerned about 
conditions in East Germany. 

No one is predicting a date for reunification. Vernon Walters, United States Ambassador

The West German constitution calls for one Germany, but until recently reunification has 
not been a paramount issue. The daily sight of thousands fleeing Honeker's hard-line 
Communist rule to the capitalist west has revived international interest in the debate.

Once dismissed as nostalgic daydreaming, the idea received a public nod from President 
Bush, and something less than a categorical "no" from President Gorbachev. Full national
Reunification would completely change the postwar order established by the victorious 
Allies. The prospect creates unrest in Britain, France, and Poland. Reunification would 
create an economic powerhouse of 80 million.</SUM>

The lifting of travel restrictions by East Germany has given new life to the idea of a 
single Germany. The recently observed 50th anniversary of the start of World War II was 
a reminder of the danger posed by a unified Germany. No one is thinking in terms of 
another war, but an undivided Germany could become the unchallenged economic and 
political force on the continent.

A top aide to former Secretary Kissinger says that reunification is terrifying to the

The Soviet Union suffered millions of deaths fighting Germany in World War II, and has 
said the idea of German reunification is "dangerous and unrealistic". There has been

Sweeping democratic reforms made under the pressure of mass protests have spurred talk 
of reuniting the two German states. The specter of a unified Germany troubles the Poles. 
A reported surge of anti-Polish sentiment in East Germany in recent weeks has

Poland's Foreign Minister spoke Thursday and tried to allay the peoples' fears. He said 
that German reunification would not occur in the near future, and when it did, Poland

The East German Communist Party, through its official newspaper, Neues Deutschland, 
provided one of the bluntest statements to date concerning the country's troubled 
situation. It admitted that the East German socialist system had failed, and expressed 
support for some type of partnership with West Germany.

Forty thousand people demonstrated for unification in Karl Marx Stadt, and in Leipzig

Soviet President Gorbachev met Tuesday with East German Premier Modrow who said 
that Gorbachev did not rule out the prospect of reunification, but did not set a time. 
Gorbachev had earlier said that any decision on Germany must include inputs from the 
Soviet Union, United States, France and Britain, and should not infringe on the interests 
of neighboring states.

A senior West German leader said on Tuesday that Gorbachev had adopted a "more 
positive" attitude toward reunification, and that East Germany, because of its political 
instability, must chose between unification and chaos.</SUM>

Soviet President Gorbachev on Tuesday said that one Germany was likely in the future,

West German Chancellor Kohl said in Moscow that Soviet President Gorbachev had 
given him an unequivocal promise to respect German reunification. He said that a 
reunification plan with the agreement of the World War II Allies should be ready before 
the year's end for presentation to pan-European summit meeting.

Pressure for German reunification has increased since the ouster of the hard-line 
Communist leadership. Despite East German reforms, nearly 2,000 leave the country 
daily, further crippling an already troubled economy. The West German Finance Minister 
said the East German economy is in sorrowful state.</SUM>

After his return from Moscow, Chancellor Kohl said that he was convinced that the two 
German states should enter into negotiations on reunification as soon as possible after the 
March 18 East German elections. He added that steps must be taken on the economic 
front, and East Germans must not leave their country.

East German elections are a little more than a month away, and the Social Democratic 
Party has taken a surprising lead in the polls. Ironically, if German reunification is 
effected before West German elections in December, their votes could help to defeat 
Kohl's Christian Democrat Party.</SUM>

The Chairman of the Simon Wisenthal Center, Rabbi Marvin Hier, wrote to West 
German Chancellor Kohl and East German Premier Modrow. The Center, based in Los

Hier asked to meet with Kohl when he is in Washington, and with Modrow in Germany

reunification, and listed actions that should be taken to allay that fear.</SUM>

Several German history experts discussed the implications of reunification after the 
Tuesday decision by the four World War II Allies decision to accept the reunification of a 
Germany they divided 45 years ago.

Most of the historians think that an East Germany moving toward chaos is a greater threat 
to stability than a United Germany. They see Germany moving ahead not out of 
nationalistic fervor but as a way to deal with chaos. One thought that it would be better 
not now in 1992, but after the West German economy had been integrated into the 
western European economy.</SUM>

reunification, and Wansee is the right place to make it. Part of the statement is that the 
Holocaust must never be repeated.</SUM>

The Bundesbank, West Germany's Central Bank, is being criticized for its refusal to 
lower interest rates to help the German economy. It is apparent to the government that  
reunification needs a strong growing West Germany economy to finance the 
subsidization of the woeful living conditions of the East Germans until there is a 
sustained upswing in the East.

The chief economist of the Bundesbank sees no reason to cut Germany's interest rates. 
The governments and central banks of Europe should make him realize that a low interest 
rate reunification boom is necessary to the European economy.</SUM>
