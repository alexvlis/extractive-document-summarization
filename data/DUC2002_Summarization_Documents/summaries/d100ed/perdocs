A biography that portrays former Beatle John Lennon as a drug addled, anorexic, 
bisexual who raged his way from Liverpool to New York is totally fiction said his 
widow, Yoko Ono.  The book also portrays Ono as a gold-digger who snorted heroin and 
was responsible for Paul McCartney's 1980 marijuana bust in Japan.  Ono admitted 
having a heroin problem in the late 1970's, but denied that Lennon was homosexual or 
that he was using drugs while living with his son Sean.   She also denied that he had 
become a recluse.  Goldman who conducted more than 1200 interviews for the book has 
written other controversial biographies.</SUM>

Lennon biographer Albert Goldman has defended his controversial biography.  In it he 
describes the former Beatle as a volatile, debauched recluse, who stayed in bed for days 
at a time.  Family and friends of John Lennon denounced the book, charging the book 
was fiction. Goldman claims that he is being attacked because his book is bad for 
business.  He says that his sensational charges of bisexuality, drug abuse and wild 
drinking binges fit together with the image Lennon presented of himself.   Goldman 
conducted 1200 interviews over 6 years while researching the book.  Yoko Ono, 
Lennon's widow did not cooperate with the author.</SUM>

Albert Goldman, author of a new biography of John Lennon, is trying to debunk the 
"undebunkable".  Apart from his puerile politics, Lennon's favorite topic was his own 
squalid history.  He talked about his voracious drug use, his perfidy to employees and his 
sexual promiscuity.  His public loved him in spite of it all.  The theme of his confessions 
was that his worst days were behind him and that with his wife, Yoko Ono, he had 
learned to prize domesticity.  Goldman portrays Ono as a cynical manipulator who 
exploited Lennon to further her own wish for wealth and fame.</SUM>

unflattering portrait of both Lennon and his second wife Yoko Ono.  Goldman claims that 
Lennon spent much of a three-year span sleeping or smoking marijuana.  Between 1976 
and 1979 the author says Lennon was a recluse.  Lennon also spent most of his adult life 
as an anorexic.  The biography also details Yoko Ono's $5,000-a-week heroin habit in 
1979.  Goldman spent more than six years researching the book, interviewing 1200 
friends, relatives and associates of Lennon, who was murdered in New York in 1980.</SUM>

Lennon's younger years.  Baird wrote the book in response to the portrayal of John 
Lennon as moody neglected child.  Baird feels that their mother has been maligned and 
decided to write the book after seeing a television show that presented her mother as an 
"unfit mother, no mother at all".  Baird was born seven years after Lennon and she and 
her sister grew up with their parents amid an extended family, including brother John.  
She writes that her mother and Lennon had a loving relationship, even though living

Imagine, a movie about the late John Lennon was more than an elegy. Though it failed to 
delve too deeply into the darker side of Lennon and the Beatles it does capture the music 
and the times in which Lennon lived.  Lennon, who was born October 9, 1940 was shot 
and killed outside his Manhattan apartment on December 8, 1980.   Lennon's widow 
collaborated in the film and described it as the definitive documentary of John Lennon's 
life.  Ono was an artist when Lennon met her and she later joined him in his music and 
demonstrations for peace.</SUM>

In the summer of 1980, drummer Andy Newmark was asked to play in John Lennon's 
new album.  Lennon had been in seclusion for five years, but in 1980 felt inspired to 
make an album with his wife Yoko Ono.  Newmark spent a month in the studio playing 
the songs that eventually ended up on "Double Fantasy" and "Milk and Honey", 
Lennon's final albums.  It was Newmark said, the highlight of my career. Prior to 
meeting Lennon, Newmark was nervous about working with him, but found that Lennon 
was just a "working musician". It took Newmark a long time to recover from Lennon's 
death.</SUM>

Soviet official newspapers, which one denounced the Beatles as harmful, joined a 
worldwide celebration and paid tribute to the late John Lennon who would have been 
fifty this year.  State radio broadcast his music and interviews about him. The celebration 
was a dramatic turnabout from Soviet repression of Beatle's fans and suppression of their 
music in earlier times.  Their music was banned and the Soviet press condemned them.  
One newspaper article attributed Lennon's success with Soviet youth in part because he 
was a rebel, like many of them and was a difficult teenager.  One fan said his music 
crosses borders easily.</SUM>
