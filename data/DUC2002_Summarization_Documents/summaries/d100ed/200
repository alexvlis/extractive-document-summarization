John Lennon spirit is still very much alive to adoring fans worldwide ten years after his 
death.  His 50th birthday was observed with a global celebration of his peace anthem 
"Imagine" which was played for an estimated 1 billion people in 130 countries.  The song 
was played following a brief ceremony at the United Nations.  Fans also gathered in 
Liverpool, Moscow, Los Angles and New York to pay tribute to the former Beatle. One 
biographer described Lennon as an anorexic bisexual addled by drugs who raged his way 
from Liverpool to New York, but friends and family denounced that version of Lennon's 
life.  Lennon himself acknowledged his drug use and sexual promiscuity, although he 
claimed that his worst days were behind him.   His wife, Yoko Ono admitted using heroin 
for a time.  He had also been portrayed as a dour, shoeless youth with an unfit mother, a 
description refuted by his half-sister in her book.   Since his death, his wife has kept his 
legacy alive, issuing new albums of his work and selling memorabilia, featuring his 
image.  Lennon was gunned down by a deranged fan outside his Manhattan apartment 
December 8, 1980 at the age of 40.</SUM>
