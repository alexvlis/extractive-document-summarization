The San Francisco 49ers won the Super Bowl in 1989 and 1990 marking the fourth win 
in four tries. Super Bowl records were set by the 49ers quarterback Joe Montana and 
wide receiver Jerry Rice. President Bush congratulated the 1989 victors at an East Room 
reception.

Super Bowl XXIV (1990) was the most watched TV event of the week although it was 
the lowest-rated Super Bowl in 21 years. Anheuser Busch Cos., Inc. and Miller Brewing 
Co., taking advantage of weeks of hype, staged mock football games in TV commercials 
using animated beer bottles.

Super Bowl XXV will kickoff in Tampa Stadium in 1991. It will feature an extravaganza 
with marching bands, a street festival and floats. Two black men were named to head a 
community relations committee in order to resolve a local racial dispute. Several 
minority-owned business won lucrative contracts with the NFL.

New tax lows place higher restrictions on what can be claimed as business-entertainment 
expense. For Super Bowl events, this means only 80% of the face value of tickets can be 
deducted. For Super Bowl XXVII in 1993, the Rose Bowl is being offered rent free to the 
NFL, along with all income from concessions and novelty sales.</SUM>
