Port workers in Szczecin, Poland and southwestern coal miners declared sympathy strikes 
with miners demanding the legalization of Solidarity according to opposition activists.  A 
local prosecutor declared the strike illegal.  In support of 3000 colleagues striking for a 
second day at a mine in Jastrzebie, workers at a nearby mine refused to take up their tools 
and launched their own strike.  The strikes mark the eighth anniversary of the birth of 
Solidarity, which Communist authorities crushed in a 1981 military crackdown.  Miners 
are demanding the legalization of Solidarity, pay raises and reinstatement of workers 
fired for union activities.</SUM>

More than 4,000 workers at a coal mine in Jastrzebie, Poland went on strike today to 
demand legalization of Solidarity, higher wages and the reinstatement of workers fired 
for union activities.  Workers at a copper mine had staged a protest rally earlier. The 
strike comes on the eighth anniversary of the founding of the outlawed trade federation.  
Solidarity was crushed in 1981, when the government imposed martial law and was 
banned nearly a year later by parliament.  In 1980 workers at factories around the port of 
Gdansk joined striking shipyard workers to form Solidarity, the first and only 
independent trade federation in the Soviet bloc.</SUM>

Workers at Poland's copper producing combine went on strike as coal mining unions 
staged token work stoppages in a third of the countries pits in a major challenge to the 
government's economic policies.  Coal miners are also demanding wage increases and a 
clear restructuring strategy for their industry.  Some coal mines have received higher 
wages although the coal mining industry is running at a loss.  Copper mining, though, 
continues to show a profit.  Coal miners have been subject to temporary lay-offs, 
reducing their incomes and leading to the unrest.  Coal production in Poland is down in 
the last year while copper production is up.</SUM>

Thousands of miners in the Vorkuta region of the Soviet Union are expanding their strike 
and are blocking coal shipments.  They are demanding the government fulfill promises to 
improve living and job conditions.   Officials said that the strikes could force fuel 
rationing during the Soviet Union's severe winter.  A regional court in Vorkuta ruled that 
the latest round of strikes is illegal, but did not impose any penalties.  Coal miners in 
Vorkuta and in Ukraine struck for two weeks in the summer, but returned to work in July 
after Parliament passed a resolution, promising reforms.</SUM>

Coal miners in Siberia ended their strike after exacting promises of better food, housing 
and working conditions, but the wave of unrest they launched continues in other key coal 
regions.  Despite President Gorbachev's announcement of sweeping concessions, 
hundreds of thousands of miners stayed off the job elsewhere.  The labor unrest is the 
Soviet Union's worst in 60 years.  Until Gorbachev rose to power in 1985, strikes were 
not tolerated.  The coal industry employs more than 1 million workers.  The government 
has agreed to make all coal operations economically and legally independent.  Gorbachev 
is trying to end central control of the economy.</SUM>

A one-day strike by coal miners in Kazakhstan and the Ukraine has grown into a 
nationwide walkout involving up to 100,000 miners demanding that President Gorbachev 
surrender power to the restive republics.  Most of the country's 1.2 million coal miners 
are still working, but output in some key regions has been halved.  The strike is the new 
union's first major test of strength.  It began as a warning in Kazakhstan and the Ukraine   
but gradually spread to all of the country's major regions.   Previous strikes have made 
only economic demands.  This time the miners want political concessions.</SUM>

Coal miners from Romania's Jiu Valley, who spearheaded violent anti-reform rampages 
through Bucharest in 1990 and 1991, are once again out on strike, pressing the 
government for higher wages.  So far the government, unlike its predecessor has not 
caved in but has begun action to have the strike declared illegal.  Romanians, most of 
who earn far less than the striking miners, appear solidly opposed to the strike.  The 
miners want more compensation for the difficult conditions in which they work and live. 
They are also following their charismatic leader, Miron Cosma, who led them on 
previously successful strikes.</SUM>

Ukrainian coal miners at the coal production association and at three pits, went on strike 
demanding payment of wage arrears.  A total of 1200 of the association's 2248 workers 
are on strike.  Workers at another mine refused to start work on their shifts until the 
mine's director assured them the arrears would be paid.  Some members are also 
demanding the dismissal of the association's director general.  In the opinion of one 
mine's representative, the strike has a clear political hue to compromise the existing 
authorities, particularly President Kravchuk, before the second round of presidential 
elections.</SUM>

South Africa will begin a strike for higher wages and better working conditions in what it 
said would be the largest job action to ever affect the nation's mining industry. Gold and 
coal account for more than half of South Africa's foreign currency earnings.  Mine

strike to have much impact unless it lasts over a month. Other mines, such as diamond

More than 10,000 coal miners in Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Indiana and West Virginia 
walked off the job to express sympathy for miners in Virginia and West Virginia, who 
have waged a bitter two-month strike against Pittston Coal Group.  Pittston dropped out 
of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association to negotiate with the union independently 
and the two sides have failed to reach an agreement despite 16 months of negotiations.  
United Mine Workers officials gave conflicting indications of whether or not they are 
responsible for the wildcat strikes.  The coal companies contend that walkouts at any 
mines other than Pittston, violate the contract with the union.</SUM>
