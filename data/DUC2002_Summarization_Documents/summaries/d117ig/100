Britain's Booker Prize for fiction novels is similar to America's Pulitzer Prize and National Book 
awards but more excitement is associated with it. British publishers each submit three new titles. 
The total of around 100 books is narrowed down to a final six by a panel of learned judges after 
they have read all the novels. Odds are given with reviews, and literary insiders bet on which 
book will win the prize. The winner is announced at a yearly banquet.

The Prize is administered by Book Trust, an educational charity, and sponsored by Booker, an 
international food and farming business.</SUM>
