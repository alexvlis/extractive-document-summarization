America has the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and the National Book Awards but in terms of 
excitement, hoopla, and man-on-the-street interests, there's nothing akin to the #15,000 
($26,000) Booker Prize. It is intended to be the equivalent of France's Prix Goncourt.

British fiction publishers each submit three new titles for a total of 93. Literary insiders bet on 
which book will win the Booker Prize. There is a team of judges, odds are given with reviews, 
the list is narrowed to the top six, and the winner announced on the last Thursday in October. 
Sales figures for the winner are stunning.</SUM>

Australian novelist Peter Carey was awarded the Booker Prize for fiction Tuesday for his mid-
19th century Australian love story, "Oscar and Lucinda". A panel of five judges, who 
unanimously announced the award of the $26,250 prize, made their selection from 102 books 
published in Britain in the last 12 months and which they read in their homes. Carey was the 
only non-Briton among the exceptionally strong competitors in the final six.

Book Trust, an educational charity promoting books, administers the Booker Prize that was first 
awarded in 1969.  It is sponsored by Booker, an international food and farming business.</SUM>

Six novels have been nominated for the Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious fiction award. 
Bookmakers say the favorite is Japanese author Kazuo Ishiguro's "The Remains of the Day" 
about a butler's travels through Britain's West Country. An odds maker gave it 7 to 4 odds.

More interest in the award than ever before is expected because of last year's controversy over 
Salmon Rushdie's "Satanic Verses". Rushdie lost out last year to Australian author Peter Carey 
for his "Oscar and Lucinda". Rushdie, a British citizen, has been hiding since February 14 when 
the Iranian leader Khomeini ordered him killed for blaspheming Islam in "Satanic Verses".</SUM>

Japanese writer Kazuo Ishiguro won the 1989 Booker Prize, Britain's top literary award, for his 
novel, "The Remains of the Day", a love story about a butler's English vacation. It explores the 
vexed themes of class, tradition, and duty. Ishiguro, 39, arrived in England at age 6 and now 
lives in south London. He was a finalist for the Booker Prize in 1986.

After receiving the prize, Ishiguro paid tribute to Salmon Rushdie, the 1988 runner-up for the 
award, who went into hiding in February when threatened with death by Moslems who said his 
novel, "The Satanic Verses" blasphemed their faith.</SUM>

The Booker Prize, Britain's literary event of the year is guaranteed to boost sales of the chosen 
novel.  The winning author receives a check for #20,000 ($38,000) sponsored by Booker, an 
international food and agriculture business. Book Trust, a charity promoting reading and books, 
administers the prize.

British publishers submit three new novels by British and Commonwealth writers. A 
management committee of authors, booksellers, librarians, and the sponsors choose a jury of 
five: a writer and/or an academic, politician, editor or critic. Each juror reads every book and 
meets with other jurists to select six finalists.</SUM>

Critic and novelist Antonia Byatt won the Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious literary award 
for "Possession", one of the year's six finalists in the 21-year old competition. She received 
$39,000 and earlier this month received the $43,000 Times-Aer Lingus prize for international 
faction for the same work. The Booker Prize was announced at a banquet in London's 
Elizabethan Guildhall, seat of the city's Lord Mayor. Her book is a tale of two young scholars 
investigating the lives of a pair of imaginary Victorian poets by retracing the poets' journeys 
across England and to France. She has published five novels since 1964.</SUM>

The annual Booker ballyhoo got going yesterday when the judges for this year's #20,000 prize 
for British (and Commonwealth) fiction announced the shortlist. The prize is no longer the 
richest literary award but it guarantees great prestige and sales for the winner and brings the 
novel to public attention.

Critics say the brouhaha distorts the annual fiction industry and the intense media hype of the 
shortlisted authors does a disservice to other gifted but unlisted authors. For weeks, London's 
literati have been betting on Michael Ondaatje's "The English Patient" and last night the 
bookmakers made it the 5-2 favorite.</SUM>

The shortlist of six for the #20,000 Booker Prize for fiction prompted the publishing industry to 
comment that some on the list "are B-team writers at best" and that others "don't make the 
grade". This is surprising commentary given it is a bumper year for new fiction fulfilling the 
criteria--English language and non-American.

There was some traditional controversy when it was revealed that an author whose novel had 
made the longlist was actually the wife of a Booker judge. But critics say it's the final list, not 
the controversy, which must have a final death blow to the Booker.</SUM>

This week, the shortlist for the hypothetical 1894 Booker Prize consists of six classic and 
bestseller books, which stirred the fin de siecle world and remain compelling today. The 
retrospective raises questions about how the relationship between literature and society has 
changed in the past 100 years.

Victorians were lovers of contemporary fiction. Middle class writers and readers were more 
homogenous and more certain of their place in the mainstream. The novel was their political and 
intellectual forum. Modernism weakened 20th century belief in the novel and the dominance of 
film and television has made novels a more marginal form.</SUM>

After hours of deliberation last night, the #20,000 Booker Prize for fiction, as it always has in its 
26-year history, provoked controversy when it went to James Kelman for "How Late It Was, 
How Late", the story of a Scottish lowlife narrated in Glaswegian dialect. Bookseller dismissed 
the whole shortlist as narcoleptic.

The chairman of the Booker judges acknowledged heated deliberation. He said the book might 
be deemed inaccessible and went on record with a rousing condemnation of contemporary 
fiction. Another judge was attacked for failing to reveal a novelist being considered for the award 
was, in fact, his wife.</SUM>
