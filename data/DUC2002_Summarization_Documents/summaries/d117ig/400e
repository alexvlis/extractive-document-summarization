<s docid="WSJ871110-0154" num="21" wdcount="30"> America has the Pulitzer Prize for 
fiction and the National Book Awards, but in terms of excitement, hoopla and 
man-on-the-street interest, there's nothing akin to the 15,000-pound ($26,000) 
Booker Prize.</s>

<s docid="AP901008-0174" num="10" wdcount="30"> The Booker Prize is 
Britain's literary event of the year, guaranteed to boost sales of the chosen 
novel after the award announcement Oct. 16, and dinner in London's ancient 
Guildhall.</s>

<s docid="AP901016-0112" num="24" wdcount="19"> The Booker Prize is 
sponsored by Booker, an international food and agriculture business, and 
administered by The Book Trust.</s>

<s docid="AP901008-0174" num="13" wdcount="13"> The trust is a charity promoting reading and books and administers the 
prize.</s>

<s docid="AP901008-0174" num="15" wdcount="29"> The prize was first awarded 
in 1969 after talks between Booker and the Publishers' Association on the need 
for a significant literary award to encourage and reward good writing.</s>


<s docid="AP901008-0174" num="16" wdcount="12"> British publishers can submit three 
new novels by British and Commonwealth writers.</s>

<s docid="AP901008-0174" num="17" wdcount="6"> There were 110 submissions last year.</s> 

<s docid="AP901008-0174" num="18" wdcount="32"> A management committee of authors, booksellers, 
librarians and the sponsors chooses a jury of five: a writer or two, an 
academic, a politician interested in literature and a literary editor or 
critic.</s>

<s docid="AP901008-0174" num="19" wdcount="21"> Each juror reads every 
book submitted, lists about six favorites and meets the other jurors to select 
and announce six finalists.</s>

<s docid="AP901008-0174" num="20" wdcount="36"> As  public debate rages over who's in, who's out and who might win, with bookmakers 
across the country calling the odds, the jurors meet again and finally select 
the winner on the afternoon of announcement day.</s>

<s docid="WSJ871110-0154" num="14" wdcount="24"> The betting is done largely by literary insiders, says Graham 
Sharpe, who sets the Booker odds at William Hill, Britain's other big betting 
agency.</s>

 <s docid="FT923-3822" num="8" wdcount="39"> The Prize (courtesy of Booker 
plc, the food and agri-business group) is no longer the richest literary award 
but it guarantees great prestige, and sales, for the winner, and, say its 
admirers, helpfully brings The Novel to public attention.</s> 

<s docid="FT923-3822" num="9" wdcount="33"> Its critics say that the autumn brouhaha distorts the 
annual fiction industry and the intense media hype of the shortlisted authors 
does a disservice to the hordes of other gifted but unlisted writers.</s>

<s docid="FT944-16774" num="19" wdcount="11"> The Booker prize has, in its 26-year 
history, always provoked controversy.</s> 

<s docid="FT944-16774" num="20" wdcount="11"> But this year's rows have been of a particularly fine vintage.</s>

<s docid="WSJ871110-0154" num="42" wdcount="18"> Indeed, there's currently talk of 
initiating a similar prize with a similar purse for the year's best 
biography.</s>

<s docid="WSJ871110-0154" num="43" wdcount="23"> Another notable 
spinoff is the Booker harpies, readers intent on digesting all six titles, then 
vigorously disputing the choices, which never please everyone.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3897" num="45" wdcount="23"> The dominance of film and television has 
made novels a more marginal form and perhaps they no longer attract the most 
creative talents.</s>
