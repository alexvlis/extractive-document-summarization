A heavily armed gunman invaded Cleveland Elementary School in Stockton and killed 
five children and wounded 30 other people before taking his own life. All five children 
were of Southeast Asian parentage. Sixty percent of the children are of Southeast Asian 
descent. Many of the parents rushing to the school in the aftermath of the shooting could 
not speak English and representatives of the Charterhouse Center refugee program put 
out an urgent call for translators. Thousands of Southeast Asians have settled in Stockton 
in recent years, drawn by the farming and the fishing opportunities in the area.</SUM>

In an attempt to reach out to the California school where five children were killed by a 
gunman, a South Carolina school will send cards and words of encouragement. Teachers 
and students of the South Carolina school understand the emotional upset of the

entered Oakland Elementary School, killing two girls and wounding nine other people. 
The 26-year-old drifter who entered the Cleveland Elementary School on Tuesday armed 
with an assault rifle had a long criminal record. The drifter took his own lifer after killing

through the third grade. Although over 600 of the 980 students are Asian, authorities are 
not certain that race was a motive. Police are still investigating what caused Purdy to 
open fire at the school with an AK-47, killing five students and injuring 29 more. His 
grandmother was at a loss to explain his behavior and an aunt described him as a loner 
and a child alcoholic. Only about 200 students returned to Cleveland Elementary today.
