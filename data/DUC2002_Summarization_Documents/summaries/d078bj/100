The Oscar nomination and selection process is under scrutiny as studios campaign to 
influence voting by Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences members. Directors  
Brooks (1988),  Spielberg (1988), and Lee (1989) are among the luminaries who were 
overlooked in the annual voting during the award's 61-year history.

Millions watch the televised awards show which can take over three hours. The 1989 
show is memorable for the number of films honored and for a musical number that 
sparked a Disney suit against the Academy.

The highly recognizable statue is not protected by copyright. Walt Disney was the most-
awarded person (32).</SUM>
