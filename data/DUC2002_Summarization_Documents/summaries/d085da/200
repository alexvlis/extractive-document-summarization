September 17-18, 1989 Hurricane Hugo devastated Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Antigua, 
the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with winds reaching 150 mph, leaving in its wake 20 
killed and about 100,000 homeless. It slowed down on Sept. 19 only to pick up strength 
again on Sept. 21, hitting Charleston, S.C. head-on at midnight with winds up to 135 
mph. Moving inland it lost strength and at 6 A.M. Sept. 22, 1989 was downgraded to a 
tropical storm. Seventeen were killed in the Carolinas and the overall damage to 
property there was more than $750 million. As the storm proceeded forecasters at the 
National Hurricane Center with the help of satellites and supercomputers analyzed 
available data and made an educated guess about the landfall on the U.S. coast. 
Charleston and the Carolina coast were alerted and a massive evacuation took place. 
Advance warning, heeded by local officials and the populace, undoubtedly saved 
hundreds or thousands of lives. Although hurricane forecasting has come a long way it 
is still not an exact science. Other hurricane research indicates that storms much 
stronger than class four Hugo may be in the offing. Scientists predict that if  sea 
temperature increases by 3-6 degrees Fahrenheit, the destructive force of hurricanes 
would increase by 50 percent.</SUM>
