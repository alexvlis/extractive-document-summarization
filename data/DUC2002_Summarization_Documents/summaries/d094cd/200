Emperor Hirohito of Japan died in 1989 at the age of 87.  He ascended to the throne in 
1926 and presided over one of Japan's most tumultuous eras.  The last of the World War 
II generation of leaders, Hirohito was a controversial figure, even in death.  While many 
western leaders praised him, many Asian leaders, whose countries suffered under the 
Japanese military during World War II were cool.  While most historians believe that 
Hirohito was a powerless figurehead, others believe that he had to have known of the 
massacre of thousands of Chinese in Nanking and of the plan to bomb Pearl Harbor.  
Some believe that the U.S. covered up his complicity in war crimes after the war to avoid 
unrest in Japan.  After the U.S. dropped the atomic bomb on Japan, Hirohito announced 
Japan's surrender in a radio address to his nation.  After the war, Hirohito was just a 
symbol but the imperial system has remained important to the Japanese people.  Hirohito 
had traveled in Europe and had a preference for Western food and clothes.  With few real 
responsibilities, he spent much time in the study of marine biology.  He died of cancer 
after a long illness and  is succeeded by his son Akihito.</SUM>
