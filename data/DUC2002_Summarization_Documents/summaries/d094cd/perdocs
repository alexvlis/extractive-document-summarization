Emperor Hirohito of Japan has been bedridden for a month with an intestinal 
hemorrhage.  He has received nearly 22 pints of blood since his illness worsened and the 
transfusions put a strain on his heart and kidneys.  Recently his blood pressure and pulse 
dipped sharply, but then returned to normal even as the internal bleeding continued.  He 
is being fed intravenously and while complaining of fatigue does not appear to be in pain.
He visited with his two sons and was described as fully conscious and alert.  Princess 
Michiko, Hirohito's daughter-in-law, scaled down celebrations for her 54th birthday.</SUM>

World leaders expressed condolences at the death of Japan's 87-year-old Emperor 
Hirohito, who surrendered his country at the end of World War II, but went on to preside 
over its economic rise.  Several Asian countries were decidedly cool however, noting the 
suffering of their people at the hands of the Japanese army during the war.  The Korean 
president referred to Japan and Korea's unhappy past.  Taiwan newspapers remarked that 
Chinese people suffered the most from Japan's invasion.  President Reagan referred to his 
reign as spanning a tumultuous and yet constructive era. The Philippine foreign secretary 
praised Hirohito as a stabilizing factor in post-war Japan.</SUM>

Emperor Hirohito will be remembered for one overwhelming decision during his 62-year 
reign.  Japan must surrender for the first time in its history and end World War II.  
Hirohito, who became emperor in 1926 at the age of 25, is generally portrayed as having 
played no significant role in Japan's military adventures in the 30's and 40's.  In 1945, 
after the U.S. dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Hirohito spoke out 
against continuing the war and in a radio address to the nation announced Japan's 
surrender.  After the war, the emperor was mainly a figurehead, but the imperial system 
has remained important to Japanese.</SUM>

World leaders sent Japan messages of condolences after Emperor Hirohito's death, but 
painful memories of World War II still generated criticism of the Japanese monarch.  
President Reagan and the president of the Soviet Union sent condolences but in South 
Korea and Taiwan reaction was cool.  Both countries suffered under the Japanese military 
during World War II.  Most historians believe that Hirohito was a powerless figurehead 
but had to approve orders to attack Pearl Harbor and the invasion of Asian countries.  He 
called on his nation to surrender in 1945.  As one man said, "Only now has World War II 
finally come to an end."</SUM>

A British Broadcasting documentary claims that U.S. prosecutors pressured Japan's 
wartime prime minister into changing testimony at his trial to avoid incriminating 
Emperor Hirohito in war crimes.  General MacArthur feared that if Hirohito were 
indicted, it would touch off a guerrilla war and the documentary claims the decision not 
to prosecute was Truman's.  The documentary challenges Hirohito's image as a peaceful 
man, saying he must have know about the massacre of Chinese at Nanking and knew 
more than a month in advance of Japan's plan to attack Pearl Harbor.  Hirohito died in 
1989 at the age of 87.</SUM>

To the rest of the world, he was known as Emperor Hirohito, but in Japan his name was 
rarely used.  Japanese found the foreign practice of using his given name impolite and 
referred to him simply as His majesty, the Emperor.  Japanese histories will record him as 
Emperor Showa, the name he chose when he became emperor in 1926.  His son, Akihito 
succeeded Emperor Hirohito and has chosen the name Heisei.  Japan numbers the years 
according to the emperor's tenure on the thrown.  Thus the first year of Hirohito's reign 
was Showa 1.  Until he died, 1989 was Showa 64, now it is Heisei 1.</SUM>

An opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times, referred to the death of Emperor Hirohito as 
finishing the list of political and military leaders of the World War II leaders, one of the 
darkest and bloodiest eras for both Asia and Europe.  Hirohito's role during the war was 
never clear but he was worshiped in Japan as a god.  The author finds it hard to believe 
that a man in Hirohito's position and with his influence, had nothing to do with Japanese 
aggression.  The author hopes that Hirohito's soul is ready to face justice when he meets 
the millions murdered in his name.</SUM>

Emperor Hirohito left $13.06 million in taxable property.  It was the first time that the tax 
authorities have disclosed the amount of a Japanese emperors taxable estate.  Until the 
end of World War II, emperors were regarded as living gods.  Hirohito died of cancer at 
the age of 87 and was succeeded by his son, Akihito.  Akihito has paid $2.99 million in 
inheritance taxes on his half of his father's estate.  The other half of the estate went to his 
mother who as Hirohito's spouse, was exempt from paying taxes.  Hirohito's estate 
included stocks and other personal belongings.  State treasures were exempt.</SUM>
