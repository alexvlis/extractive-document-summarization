Emperor Hirohito of Japan died in 1989 at the age of 87.  He ascended the throne in 1926 
and presided over one of Japan's most tumultuous eras.  The last of the World War II 
generation of leaders, Hirohito was a controversial figure, even in death.  While western 
leaders generally, Asian leaders whose countries suffered under the Japanese military in 
World War II were cool.  While some historians regard him as a powerless figurehead, 
others believe that he was complicit in Japanese war crimes.  Hirohito died of cancer after 
a long illness and is succeeded by his son Akihito.</SUM>
