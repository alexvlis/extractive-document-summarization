Soviet hard-liners staged a coup in order to prevent implementation of
Gorbachev's reforms. Some viewers suspected a Gorbachev role in the coup as
a ploy to solidify his position. The coup ended after three days due mainly
to opposition by Boris Yeltsin who rallied thousands in opposition.  Coup
leaders were arrested and Gorbachev was returned to the presidency.
Gorbachev still hoped to implement reforms working through the Communist
Party.  Yeltsin, however, had quit the party and wanted to see its influence
lessened.  Yeltsin was clearly moving into a greater leadership role in the
new Russia.</SUM>
