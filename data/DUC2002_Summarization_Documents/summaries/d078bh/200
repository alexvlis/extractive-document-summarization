Oscar nominations and victories increase film earnings, and studios woo the 4600 voting 
members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to get their votes. The 
annual awards ceremony has generated a wealth of Oscar award trivia. The Irving 
Thalberg award for consistently high quality has become useful for acknowledging 
overlooked giants and salving the academy's conscience. Steven Spielberg, never 
nominated for an individual achievement even though his films are record moneymakers, 
received it in 1987. 32-year-old Spike Lee blamed the paucity of nominations for his 
critically acclaimed "Do the Right Thing" on generational politics and racism. 
Oscar shows have been criticized for their excesses of commercialism, production 
numbers, and meaningless awards.  In 1989, Disney sued the academy for opening the 
program with a Snow White routine. The academy closely protects the Oscar's name and 
image. It sued when a film festival award and an employee-incentive trophy were too 
similar, but a federal judge ruled that the statuette had no copyright protection. The 
academy has also tried to block the sale of statuettes. The Oscar, manufactured by 
Chicago's R.S. Owens Co., weighs 8 pounds and stands 13 inches tall. It is made of 
Britannia metal and plated with copper, nickel, and gold.</SUM>
