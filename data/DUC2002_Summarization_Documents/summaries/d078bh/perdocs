The Oscar, created 60 years ago by MGM art director Cedric Gibbons, weighs 8 pounds 
and stands 13 inches tall. It is made of Britannia metal and plated with copper, nickel, 
and gold. From 1942-44 it was made of plaster. It is manufactured by Chicago's R.S. 
Owens Co. 1,816 have been produced so far. The only engraving mistake was "Dick 
Tracy" instead of "Spencer Tracy" in 1938. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and 
Sciences reserves the first right to buy an Oscar from anyone. "All About Eve" is the 
most-nominated film (14), Ben Hur the most awarded (11), and Walt Disney the most-
awarded person (32).</SUM>

The Academy Awards are criticized for their unfairness when films get nominated but 
their directors don't, perhaps out of professional jealousy. For instance, director Steven 
Spielberg has never been nominated for an individual achievement even though his films 
are the biggest moneymakers in history. The Irving Thalberg award for consistently high 
quality of production has come in handy for acknowledging giants who were overlooked 
and for salving the academy's conscience. Spielberg received the Thalberg award in 
1987. In 1986 the Directors Guild named him best director. Films that became classics 
have been overlooked, too. "Citizen Kane" won only for its script.</SUM>

The annual Academy Awards ceremony has generated a wealth of statistics and trivia in 
its 60 years. Oscar historians chronicle what actors, directors, studios, and films have 
received the most Oscars or been nominated most often. Other factoids concern the 
youngest, oldest, or posthumous recipients; family members who have been recipients in 
the same picture; actors nominated in multiple categories, performers who have refused 
their Oscars, those who have never appeared to collect their award; the number of TV 
viewers, the number of countries watching, the speed of reading the rules, and who 
decapitated his Oscar while practicing his golf swing.</SUM>

Oscar nominations and victories increase film earnings, with a Best Picture award worth 
about $20 million. Studios go to increased lengths to get votes, with promotional ads, 
banquets, and gifts. Members working in specific categories make nominations, but all 
voting members may vote in all categories. Over 4600 members receive ballots. Voting is 
on the honor system, but there is no guarantee that academy members fill out their own 
ballots. Some Oscar voting is done by committee, in violation of voting rules, when 
voters unfamiliar with the candidates seek the consensus of friends. Authenticity is 
ensured solely by a control number.</SUM>

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences tries to keep Oscar's sheen from 
being tarnished by commercialism, even though it itself suggested limousines bringing 
celebrities to the awards have door-mounted coolers bearing the Coca Cola logo. It 
criticized MGM-UA for touting "Rain Man" nominations before they were made. Oscar 
sales have brought over $17,000 for heirs or friends, but the Academy sued to block 
future sales, insisting winners agreed not to sell the trophies without first offering them to 
the Academy for a nominal fee. The Academy lost its suit claiming the Houston 
International Film Festival's similar Lone Star Statuette was a copyright infringement.</SUM>

This year's Academy Award show had too much dazzle and glamour, too many endless 
production numbers, and too many awards with meaning lost to the general public. The 
use of presenting couples was clever but wearing and conversation between them was 
often forced. The best Oscar shows have been emceed by comics who provided 
continuity as well as a leavening of pomposity. The show has grown from five minutes to 
the current 3.25 hours, the time needed to sell sufficient 30-second ads for $375,000 each. 
This year's show had its own set of bests, worsts, and mosts in categories of acceptance 
speech, appearance, behavior, entertainment, etc.</SUM>

1989's films were an improvement over recent years, as the industry adjusted to an older, 
more demanding audience. This year's Oscars went to 10 different movies, making for a 
great show and righting some past wrongs. Not all awards went to box-office hits. Jodie 
Foster got Best Actress for "The Accused" and Geena Davis got Best Supporting Actress 
for "The Accidental Tourist". "Bird" won for sound editing and "The Milagro Beanfield 
War" won for its score, even though both films were flawed.  "Rain Man" won four 
Oscars, including Best Picture. "Dangerous Liaisons" and "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" 
won three each. "Mississippi Burning" won only cinematography, punishment for its 
historical muddling.</SUM>

This year's Academy Awards ceremonies opened with an elaborate, 10-minute Snow 
White song-and-dance routine, without Disney's permission. The Academy of Motion 
Picture Arts and Sciences told Disney only that the program contained no material 
deleterious to Disney interests. Disney sued for copyright infringement when the 
academy refused to publicly apologize for unauthorized use of the Disney character. 
Ironically, the academy closely protects the Oscar's copyrighted name and image. The 
Snow White character portrayed Wednesday night was created by Steve Silver, who has 
used the character in the San Francisco musical revue "Beach Blanket Babylon" for 15 
years. Disney has never sued Silver but didn't rule out the possibility.</SUM>

Federal judge Laughlin Waters ruled Thursday that the Oscar statuette itself has no 
copyright protection. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences had sued 
Chicago-based Creative House Promotions, manufacturer of an employee-incentive 
trophy called the Star Award, for copyright infringement. The Star Award depicts a 
naked, muscular male similar to the Oscar but two inches shorter and holding a star 
instead of a sword. The judge said the statuette became part of the public domain prior to 
Jan 1, 1978, the effective date of the Copyright Act of 1976. From 1929-1941, Oscars did 
not bear the symbol denoting copyright. The academy will appeal the ruling.</SUM>

Spike Lee's 1989 movie "Do the Right Thing" was widely hailed by critics but received 
only two Academy Award nominations -- neither one Best Picture or Best Director. 32-
year-old Lee blamed this on generational politics and racism, saying the academy 
consisted mainly of "old people," who were more comfortable with black chauffeurs than 
with the angry characters in his film. He considered his film the best of the year. But 
students at a lecture and question-and-answer session at Syracuse University Monday 
gave Lee -- one of the first African-Americans to succeed as a producer and director -- a 
warm reception, saying he addressed issues affecting their community.</SUM>
