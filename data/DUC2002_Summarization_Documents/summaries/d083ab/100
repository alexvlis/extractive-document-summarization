A violent storm spawned tornadoes and thunderstorms across the Midwest and South, 
then blew north knocking over a school cafeteria wall in upstate New York, killing seven 
children.  Altogether, fourteen states and Washington D.C. were affected.  The toll from 
the two-day storm is at least 27 dead and over 500 hundred injured.   Property damage is 
in the millions.  The worst damage by far was in Huntsville, Alabama where a tornado 
slammed into a shopping district, a residential area and a school, leaving at least 14 dead 
and injuring nearly 300.  The Governor called in State Troopers and the National Guard 
to assist.</SUM>
