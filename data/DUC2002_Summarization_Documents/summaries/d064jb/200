"Golden Arches" continues its worldwide expansion.  In 1988, seven years after its first 
attempt to bring a restaurant to South Korea, McDonald's successfully joint-ventured 
with Ahn Hyo Young, a Harvard schooled entrepreneur. McAhn Enterprises Ltd. had to 
fight government red tape and develop local suppliers in order to open in Seoul.  That 
year, Big Mac also braved the communist world.  On March 24, 1988, McDonald's 
successfully opened in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.  Its local competition was the hamburger-
like pljeskavica, i.e., ground pork and onion served on bread and eaten by hand.  Two 
years later, McDonald's had their most successful opening ever, worldwide.  In Pushkin 
Square, Moscow, thousands of people waited in line for hours at the largest McDonald's 
in the world for hamburgers, fries and shakes.  This opening day "Mac attack" resulted in 
30,000 meals being served over fourteen hours at 27 cash registers.  Customers were 
surprised and pleased to find efficient, friendly workers in this country of generally surly 
service.  And then, China, where cooking is a culinary art.  A restaurant opened in 
Shenzhen, a special economic zone outside of Hong Kong where the average worker's 
pay there is considerably higher than in the rest of China.  McDonald's hopes to soon 
expand into Mainland China.</SUM>
