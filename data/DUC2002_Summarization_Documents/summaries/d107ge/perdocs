Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, speaking at a meeting of farm magazine, extension, 
advertising, co-op, and broadcasting editors, said that although the United States is 
suffering from a severe drought, the U.S. will continue to be a major player in world 
agriculture. The early season drought is the worst since record keeping began in 1895. A 
large portion of the U.S. was suffering from drought stress and about 35 percent of the 
contiguous United States was rated severe to extreme by July 2. If the drought continues, 
the area affected could exceed the 60 percent of 1934 and the 50 percent of 1954.</SUM>

Farmers could expect little relief from the drought in the near term according to weather 
forecasters. The outlook for the next 30 days to three months indicates that the areas 
worst hit by the drought can expect little relief with chances of a less than normal amount 
of rainfall  ranging from 55 percent in the major grain growing states to 70 percent in part 
of southern California. This news came as President Reagan headed to the Midwest to see 
drought-plagued farms. The current drought is not yet as bad as those suffered in the 
1930s and the 1950s but does equal one in 1911.</SUM>

The drought and high temperatures continue to plague sections of the United States. In an 
effort to stave off the worst effects of the drought, farmers in Oregon shipped 20 tons of 
hay to Kentucky and other states were compiling information on where hay might be 
available. In other areas, the Alabama National Guard continued to supply water to 10 
communities. Even though the state has had rain, it is not enough to counteract the effects 
of the drought. Parts of the upper Midwest also have received rain, but at least 10 inches 
more are need to return the water table to normal levels.</SUM>

The current drought may be cause for the government to ease crop acreage restrictions 
next year in an effort to rebuild the grain industry. Grain and soybean futures have 
dropped to their lowest levels in more than five weeks. Even so, Agriculture Secretary 
Lyng expects that the United States will be able to bounce back from its losses next year. 
House Speaker Wright hopes a disaster relief package will reach the House floor next 
week. This comes as Kentucky criticized the U.S. for its slowness to act. This drought as 
affected a larger portion of the U.S. than any drought recorded since records began being 
kept in 1895.</SUM>

The world grain stock levels are expected to drop in the wake of the continued drought in 
the United States. The grain stocks are projected to fall below 310 million tons, 17 
percent of what is considered necessary to safeguard world food security. As a result, 
many poorer countries could face a food shortage as grain prices rise. The crops most 
affected are maize, barley and oats. Good harvests are expected in other parts of the 
world but in the Sahel region of sub-Saharan Africa, damage from locust could cause 
crops losses of 1 million tons.</SUM>

Weather experts are calling for more research and study in an effort to understand the 
conditions causing the present drought. At a weather symposium attended by 13 state and 
national experts, attendees stressed that there were an enormous number of possibilities 
to consider and that the job at hand was to extend the range of analysis in looking for 
cause and effect. A hurricane specialist said this year's hurricane activity is expected to 
be heavier than normal, but stressed that a hurricanes effect on drought is variable. Even 
so, some southeastern states get as much as 25 percent of the annual rainfall from 
hurricanes.</SUM>

Drought conditions continue to affect the nation as state officials seek to deal with the 
water shortage. In Alabama, recent rains have done little to help urban areas and the 
state's cotton supply is in critical condition while officials of Elk Horn, Iowa look for 
drinking water for their town. High temperatures in other areas, combined with the 
drought have raised the danger of forest fires and have threatened logging interests in 
Michigan. Elsewhere, severe summer storms which have spawned tornados in Kansas 
and caused high winds in Indiana and Michigan, causing widespread damage did little to 
alleviate drought conditions in those states.</SUM>

Climatologists meeting at a symposium sponsored by the Weather Channel warned that 
public concern over the drought will end with improvement in the weather. Many of the 
13 climatologists and meteorologists meeting at the symposium agreed that the earth's 
temperature is rising but were unsure if this were a short tem or long term phenomenon 
but stated that policymakers need to begin to deal with its possible effects. Stating that 
our reliance on fossil fuels must be reduced, Alan Hecht, director of the National Climate 
Program said we must become more energy efficient and seek alternative energy 
supplies.</SUM>

Many drought affected areas were deluged by downpours that bought as much as 6 inches 
of rain to parts of Texas and Arkansas. Widespread showers and thunderstorms as 
brought rain to much of the Midwest, the Middle Atlantic, and Gulf Coast states. The 
rains came as Congress began working on a package of relief for America's farmers. 
Meanwhile, farmers in Kentucky received the first shipment of hay airlifted from Oregon. 
The drought has dried up pastures, forcing farmers to seek elsewhere for hay. Despite the 
recent rains, communities with water problems still face water restrictions for the 
foreseeable future.</SUM>
