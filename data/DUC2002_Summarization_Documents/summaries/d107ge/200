A severe drought has affected large portions of the United States as rainfall was below 
normal in major grain growing states. The drought, rated severe by July 2, is the worst 
noted since the U.S. began keeping records in 1895 and affects about 35 percent of the 
contiguous United States.  If conditions continue, the areas affect could exceed the 60 
percent of 1934 and the 50 percent of 1954. The drought has caused grain and soybean 
futures to drop and grain stocks are projected to fall below 310 million tons, or 17 percent 
of what is considered necessary to safeguard world food security. Many poorer nations 
could face food shortages as grain prices rise. Many communities from Iowa to Alabama 
face water shortages that leave officials seeking alternate water supplies. Other areas 
have imposed bans on outdoor water use. Heavy storms which have spread across the 
nation have brought deluges to Texas and Arkansas, tornados to Kansas, and damaging 
high winds to Michigan and Indiana but water restrictions will remain in effect for the 
immediate future. Kentucky received its first of hay from Oregon. Farmers in Kentucky, 
as in other states, were forced to seek hay elsewhere when the drought dried up pastures.</SUM>
