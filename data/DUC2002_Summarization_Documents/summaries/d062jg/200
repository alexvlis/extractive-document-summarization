In the aftermath of California's earthquake Tuesday, the White House reacted quickly--partly to 
get federal aid flowing--and also to protect an image of the White House in action. The White 
House and the Federal Emergency Management Agency were accused of slow response to the 
Exxon Valdez oil spill and Hurricane Hugo. The Governor of California is assuring victims that 
the state will provide aid.  Analysts and industry spokesmen say only about 25-30% of homes in 
the San Francisco area have earthquake insurance.

Insurers may have to pay billions of dollars for the earthquake.  The damage goes far beyond that 
of Hurricane Hugo last month.  Insurers are rushing into the area to process claims but no 
company is expected to suffer serious financial damage. Investors hope the financial and 
psychological impact of the earthquake will stem price-cutting wars between insurers the past 
two years. It is predicted that the quake damages may in fact lead to rate hikes. Insurers and state 
legislators are battling over rates and how they are set. Insurers as a whole are likely to increase 
the amount of reinsurance they buy, which will translate into an overall price rise.</SUM>
