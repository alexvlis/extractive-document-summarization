<s docid="LA102489-0131" num="8" wdcount="44"> With Congress already moving to grant up to $3 billion in relief, earthquake victims 
need to know that state officials are prepared to come up with the state's share 
of disaster and reconstruction aid as soon as possible, and as soon as is 
practical.</s>

<s docid="AP891018-0301" num="9" wdcount="34"> Most San Francisco-area 
homeowners may have to pay for damage from Tuesday's earthquake out of their own

<s docid="AP891018-0301" num="11" wdcount="26"> The Association of California Insurance Cos. in

years of intense price-cutting wars among business insurers.</s> 

<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="35" wdcount="17"> Indeed, the earthquake could contribute

<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="37" wdcount="35"> Such increased demand 
for reinsurance, along with the losses the reinsurers will bear from these two

translated into an overall price rise.</s>
