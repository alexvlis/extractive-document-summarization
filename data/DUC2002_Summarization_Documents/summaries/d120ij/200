In early May elections across Britain, the Conservatives suffered their worst defeat ever, 
losing 444 seats. One editorial claims some Conservatives will link the defeats to Prime 
Minister John Major, and there is speculation that he could be forced out this autumn.

A former welfare recipient, John Major was elected Conservative Party leader and 
successor to his mentor Margaret Thatcher when she resigned under pressure in 
November 1990. After Mrs. Thatcher submitted her seals of office, Major was called by 
Queen Elizabeth II to form a new government, and it was expected that there would be no 
significant policy shift. Major's comment while visiting America a month later that Iraqi 
troops might have to be "forcibly removed" from Kuwait echoed Mrs. Thatcher's hard-
line on the Persian Gulf.

Within a year of winning the general election, his popularity had plunged. In the July 
1993 Christchurch by-election the Conservative majority of 23,015 the previous year was 
converted into a 16,427 majority for the Liberal Democrats. Though Major's personal 
style is preferable to that of Mrs. Thatcher, he is characterized as a vacillating, weak 
leader, lacking vision and political conviction. Not even recent revelations that Major 
uses salty language can alter his wimp image.</SUM>
