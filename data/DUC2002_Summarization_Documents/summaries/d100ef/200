The late, ex-Beatle John Lennon who was murdered in New York in 1980, had
thousands of fans worldwide that loved his music and admired him for his
charitable work and efforts to promote peace. Lennon had conceded problems
with drugs and other misdeeds in earlier years but in The Lives of John
Lennon, celebrity biographer Albert Goldman alleges that Lennon remained a
drug user, was bisexual, reclusive, anorexic, and had wild drinking binges.
Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, his first wife, Cynthia, and his sons refute those
allegations and, at least one reviewer trashed the book.

Lennon was pretty much out of sight for nearly five years prior to the
summer of 1980 when he returned to the studio and recorded two albums.
Musicians said that he never sang better.  On what would have been the 50th
anniversary of his birth, and after a brief ceremony at the United Nations,
Lennon's song "Imagine" was broadcast for an estimated one billion people
worldwide.  On the tenth anniversary of his death, observances were held in
Liverpool, Moscow, Los Angeles, and New York.

Ono has kept Lennon "alive" through a movie, radio, and albums.  However,
she is accused of shamelessly exploiting Lennon's memory for personal
financial gain.</SUM>
