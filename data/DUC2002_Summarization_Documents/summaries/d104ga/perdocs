On Saturday at 1 a.m. tens of thousands of troops entered Beijing from the east 
marching toward Tiananmen Square.  Blocked east of the square by thousands of 
people, the troops dispersed, walking around near the square in small groups. About 
noon two truckloads of People's Armed Police attacked crowds east of the square. 
Later about 5,000 troops appeared firing tear gas and clubbing protesters west of the 
square. Skirmishes continued until 9 p.m. when troops started firing at the rock-throwing 
protesters. Shooting continued through the night until 5 a.m. Sunday morning when the 
demonstrators,  surrounded by armed and firing troops, began leaving the square, 
ending their three-week occupation.</SUM>

Today's killings and flight of hundreds of thousands of protesters from Tiananmen 
Square is the outcome of events beginning with the death of former Communist party 
chief Hu Yaobang on April 15 this year. By April 17 thousands of students were 
marching in Beijing and Shanghai shouting "Long live Hu Yaobang! Long live 
democracy!" During May the protest movement focused on Tiananmen Square after 
about 2,000 students began a hunger strike there and a million citizens rallied to their 
support. When declaration of martial law did not intimidate the protesters the 
government resorted to the massive use of troops and firepower.</SUM>

The pro-democracy banners and protesters' tents are now gone from Tiananmen 
Square, replaced by tanks and drilling soldiers. The replica of the Statue of Liberty is 
gone, replaced by a tread-wheeled personnel carrier. Poems and posters calling for a 
more open China have disappeared and now 80 tanks and 40 armored personnel 
carriers line the northern part of the square. Much has changed since the military swept 
into Beijing six days ago, and who knows at what cost? The government says that 
nearly 300 people, mostly soldiers, were killed. Diplomats, Chinese citizens and 
Chinese Red Cross officials estimate the death toll at more than 3,000.</SUM>

The battle for Tiananmen Square was fought primarily  in the streets leading to the 
square where scores of people fell trying to prevent troops and armored military 
vehicles from moving on the students camped in the square. The first troops entered 
the square about 1 a.m. Sunday followed by a huge convoy of armored vehicles that 
surrounded the few thousand students that remained. A propaganda battle by 
loudspeaker ensued. By 4:30 a.m. the students decided by voice vote to leave the 
square to avoid further bloodshed. As dawn broke rifle-toting troops ruled the vast 
expanse occupied the day before by students seeking a freer society.</SUM>

The exact number of people killed during the martial law occupation of Beijing may 
never be known. One government statement says that 300 soldiers, "thugs," bystanders 
and students have been killed. Another says that 400 missing soldiers may be dead or 
wounded. Unofficial estimates of the death toll range from 500 to 12,000 people. 
Officials of the Chinese Red Cross estimated 2,600 killed while one Hong Kong 
newspaper said that 5,000 were killed and 30,000 injured. Nearly all of the deaths and 
injuries occurred Saturday night and early Sunday when troops fired randomly into large 
crowds while forcing their way to Tiananmen Square.</SUM>

Chinese troops stormed Tiananmen Square early Sunday, shooting and beating their 
way through crowds of pro-democracy protesters. The assault came two weeks after 
Premier Li Peng declared martial law in Beijing. Sporadic clashes were reported on 
Saturday as soldiers made several attempts to reach the square. They retreated 
temporarily under a barrage of rocks and other objects but resumed their push more 
violently at about 8 p.m. firing weapons and using tear gas as they moved toward 
Tiananmen. By 3:30 a.m. Sunday troops had surrounded the square. At 4:30 armored 
personnel carriers entered the square and began slowly moving toward the several 
thousand students who remained.</SUM>

As soldiers continued firing into crowds around Beijing and sprayed a diplomatic 
compound with bullets yesterday, foreign embassies ordered their nationals to leave the 
city. This morning Premier Li Peng answered anti-government demonstrations in 
Shanghai, Nanjing and other cities and condemnation from around the world by praising 
the soldiers who crushed earlier student demonstrations and demanding that student 
leaders surrender. It is apparent that martial law and the assault on Tiananmen Square 
last Sunday has not put an end to the pro-democracy movement in China which began 
on April 18 after the death of former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang.</SUM>

As armies loyal to rival factions exchanged fire and soldiers continued to fire into 
crowds around Beijing today, anti-government demonstrations spread to Shanghai, 
Nanjing, Chengdu and other cities. Other nations have urged their citizens to leave 
Beijing. Yesterday the U.S. suspended all military sales and visits of Chinese military 
leaders in response to the violent suppression of the pro-democracy movement in 
China which began on April 18 after the death of former Communist Party chief Hu 
Yaobang. It is now apparent that the assault on Tiananmen Square last Sunday neither 
ended the movement nor ended the government's forceful answer to demands for 
reform.</SUM>

This morning New York City's Chinatown responded to events in Beijing. More than 
5,000 people chanting, "Freedom will survive!" packed a Chinatown park in a memorial 
service for students killed by soldiers in Tiananmen Square.  The crowd stood 
respectfully and silently during a traditional funeral ceremony and then marched through 
the streets in a funeral procession waving banners honoring "the martyrs of Tiananmen 
Square." As they headed up Mulberry Street, a major street in Chinatown, they walked 
beneath a 30-foot black banner. Demonstrators planned another rally later in the day 
outside the United Nations.</SUM>
