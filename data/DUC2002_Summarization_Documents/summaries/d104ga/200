On June 3, 1989 at 1 a.m. tens of thousands of troops entered Beijing marching 
toward Tiananmen Square to dislodge student pro-democracy demonstrators who had  
encamped there for three weeks. Within 28 hours the students were dispersed at a 
cost in lives estimated by the Chinese government at 300-400, by officials of the 
Chinese Red Cross as 2,600, and by others as between 3,000 and 12,000. The crisis 
was not at an end, however, as soldiers continued random shooting of civilians and rival 
factions of the Chinese army started shooting at one another. During June 5-9 
governments around the world condemned the brutal suppression advising their
nationals to leave Beijing. Chinese abroad mourned the dead. Anti-government 
demonstrations spread to Shanghai, Nanjing, and other cities. The pro-democracy 
movement had its origin with the death of former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang 
on April 15, 1989. By April 17 thousands of students marched in Beijing and Shanghai 
shouting "Long live Hu Yaobang! Long live democracy!" The protest movement focused 
on Tiananmen Square when 2,000 students began a hunger strike there  and a million 
citizens rallied to their support. When declaration of martial law did not intimidate the 
protesters the government resorted to the massive use of troops and firepower.</SUM>
