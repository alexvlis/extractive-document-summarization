The military assault on pro-democracy students in Tiananmen Square on
June 3-4, 1989 cost at least 2,600 lives and perhaps as many as
12,000. 2,000 students had encamped in the square and begun a hunger
strike in May and a million citizens rallied to their support. When
the declaration of martial law did not intimidate the students and
their supporters, the government resorted to the use of massive
force. The pro- democracy movement started after the death of former
Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang on April 15, 1989 with students
shouting "Long live Hu Yaobang! Long live democracy!"</SUM>
