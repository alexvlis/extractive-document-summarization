rising by 5.6 per cent on Monday and Tuesday.</s>

<s docid="FT931-2858" num="10" wdcount="23"> But another bomb blast in Calcutta

<s docid="FT931-2858" num="11" wdcount="44"> All this has taken place against a 
volatile background: the Bombay equity market, over the past six weeks or so,

disappointment.</s>

<s docid="FT931-2858" num="12" wdcount="18"> Dr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance

Narasimha Rao to open up the economy and attract foreign investment and 
tourism.</s>

<s docid="FT931-3664" num="38" wdcount="27"> But much more should go to the people of

the bombers .</s>
