In March of 1993 the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) experienced a series of shocks, 
but emerged on the upbeat. The first blow was reaction to a report from the Indian 
finance minister on February 27 postponing corporate tax reform. Disappointed with the 
postponement, traders sold with a vengeance driving equity prices to a 13-month low 
with the BSE index down to 2,287 on March 10 compared to 2,893 on February 27. 
Then the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) accused the BSE of violating 
regulations limiting speculative investments. On the night of March 12 the BSE was 
damaged as thirteen bombs exploded in Bombay killing at least 255 people, injuring 
over 1,200 and threatening resumption of intercommunal riots between Hindus and 
Moslems. Despite structural damage, the BSE reopened on March 15. On March 16 an 
explosion in a residential district of Calcutta killed at least 45. A Sikh group claimed 
responsibility but official Indian comments implied that Pakistan was the main suspect. 
With the looming threat of riots and war, the BSE index rose by 2.1 per cent on March 
15 and even after the Calcutta bombing settled at 2,409.23 on March 17, a marked 
improvement over the March 10 reading.</SUM>
