The death toll from floods in eastern Ohio rose to 21 and may to higher
since 14 persons are still missing.  Torrential rains caused two creeks near
Shadyside, Ohio, overflow and create a wall of water 15 to 20 feet high.
The flood raged through the valley demolishing a crowded tavern and at least
70 houses.  Governor Celeste declared a state of emergency and sent National
Guard troops into the area to assist.  Dog teams were used to search for
survivors and bodies.  Few of the damaged homes were covered by flood
insurance so the owners must look to federal assistance.</SUM>
