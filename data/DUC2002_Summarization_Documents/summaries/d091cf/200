Flash floods raged through small towns along the Ohio River in eastern Ohio
on Thursday.  Death toll from the flood was put at ten initially, but was
raised to 21 as more bodies were found.  The number may still go higher
since little hope remains for the fourteen still unaccounted for.  The
floods hit two creeks near Shadyside, Ohio, about 10 miles south of
Wheeling, West Virginia.  Five and a half inches of rain fell in slightly
more than three hours. The flood created a wall of water 15 to 20 feet high
as it tore through the area.   The force of the raging water demolished a
crowded tavern in Shadyside.  A nine-year-old girl who was swept into the
creek and on into the Ohio River miraculously survived a seven mile ordeal
by clinging to logs.

Ohio Governor Celeste declared a state of emergency after surveying the
area.  The National Guard was brought in to patrol and help rebuild roads.
Dog teams from four states were used in searching for survivors and bodies.

Few homeowners had flood insurance to aid in rebuilding lost or damaged
homes.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency planned to accept
low-interest loan and grant applications.</SUM>
