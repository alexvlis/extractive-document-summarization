Marathons attract both professional athletes as well as amateur runners.  Some 
marathons, such as Los Angeles', concentrate on the commercial and moneymaking side 
of marathons, while other cities such as New York, Boston and San Francisco attract 
world-class runners.  Prior to the 1992 Olympic trials, topped ranked women marathon 
runners flocked to San Francisco, one of the only cities in the world suitable for summer 
running. The 1992 Barcelona Olympic marathon was one of the most grueling ever.  Run 
in the late afternoon heat and humidity, it featured a course where the last 10 kilometers 
was mostly uphill.  Other marathons are geared more to amateur runners than 
professionals. The Marine Corp marathon in Washington D.C offers no prizes and bills 
itself as the "peoples race". The San Diego marathon in 1990 was won by relative 
newcomers to long-distance running in what the men's winner described as a "weak 
field". Tour companies sponsor international trips organized around marathons, offering 
clients a chance to run in some of the most popular marathons in the world.  Age is no 
barrier to marathon running.  Eighty-three year-old John Kelley planned to run in his 60th 
marathon in Boston.  He won the event in 1935 and 1945.</SUM>
