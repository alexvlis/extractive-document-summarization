The exact distance of a marathon is 26 miles and 385 yards. It is often expressed as 26.2 
miles. Marathons are very popular, and major cities of the world organize marathons that 
draw thousands of participants. London, Berlin, Rome, Paris, Stockholm, Vienna, 
Budapest, Brussels, Munich, Bangkok and Tel Aviv are some of the cities that organize 
annual marathons. Tour companies even offer "marathon tours" to distant marathons. 
Most of the thousands who run do so only for self-satisfaction, but others compete for 
monetary prizes offered by most marathons. The Marine Corps marathon in Washington, 
D.C. is one that does not offer prize money.

Marathons are usually run in the early morning hours to take advantage of cooler 
temperatures and cleaner air. The organizers of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics were 
criticized for contesting the marathon in the late afternoon heat.

The London Marathon is the world's largest. The Boston Marathon is the most storied. It 
goes back almost a century, and in 1992, 83 year-old John Kelley was planning to run in 
his 60th Boston Marathon. The Los Angeles Marathon is renown as the best-marketed 
marathon. An Diego and San Francisco pride themselves for providing the most 
marathon-friendly weather.</SUM>
