Marathons are contested over a course that measures 26 miles and 385 yards. They are 
very popular, and most of the world's major cities organize an annual marathon.. Tour 
companies even put together "marathon tours" to accommodate runners. Most marathons 
offer substantial prize money to race winners, but most in the throngs of participants run 
only for a sense of accomplishment.

Each city tailors its marathon to provide the best of its natural beauty and history. London 
has the largest, and Boston the most storied. San Francisco and San Diego boast of their 
weather conditions.</SUM>
