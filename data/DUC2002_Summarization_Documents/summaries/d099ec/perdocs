More than 18,000 runners are expected to run in the 1987 Los Angeles Marathon. Other 
marathons have had corporate backing, but Los Angeles is out in front in making a 
marathon into a commercial spectacle. Makers of cars, cameras, soft drinks, banks, and 
even a hospital have signed on as sponsors in Los Angeles. 

The city has given the promoters an eight-year operating contract. Unlike most 
marathons, Los Angeles does not pay appearance money to the better runners. Last year 
the marathon grossed four million dollars. This year promoters expect to gross five 
million, and break even for the first time.</SUM>

The 1988 New York City Marathon drew a field of over 23,000 runners. It was the 
largest field in the 19-year history of the marathon. Steve Jones of Wales was the man's 
winner, and Grete Waitz of Norway won the women's division for a record ninth time. 
Enthusiastic spectators cheered all the participants, but were most interested in friends or 
family who were participating.

More than 13,000 runners from 13 countries and 49 states ran the Marine Corps 
Marathon in Washington, D.C. Unlike most marathons, the one in Washington pays no 
prize money to winners.</SUM>

The 1990 Los Angeles Marathon has an impressive list of commercial sponsors. 
Mercedes-Benz of North America is the presenting sponsor of the race, making it one of 
ten companies that not only pay to be called sponsor, but also put money outright into the 
race or provide products and services.

The marathon is not yet a world-class event, but it is the best-marketed, slickest and 
sponsor-driven of the world's major marathons. President Bill Burke and Vice President 
Marie Patrick who have marketing backgrounds drive the race's marketing philosophy.</SUM>

The 1990 San Diego Marathon was run on the North County course. It was the first 
marathon to be run there. Contestants liked the new course. The marathon was run in 
beautiful weather, with warm breezes and 74-degree readings.

Over 4,000 runners participated, but the field was considered to be a weak one. Benjamin 
Martinez of Mexico was the men's winner. Kathy Smith of Newport Beach was the 
fastest woman. Each received two thousand dollars for the victory. Both are relatively 
new to running the marathon distance of 26.2 miles, and for each it was the first marathon 
victory.</SUM>

temperatures during June range in the 50s,making it an ideal mid-summer marathon.

The clinic gives a stress test and Kelley holds the endurance record for his age group. 
Doctor Cooper says Kelley is a medical marvel.</SUM>

Copying what is regularly done for tennis and ski enthusiasts, creative tour companies 
here and abroad have come up with "marathon tours". A typical package includes air 
fare, lodging, specified social activities in connection with the marathon, entry fees, and a 
guaranteed spot in restricted entry races. For those not up to the full 26.2 miles of a 
marathon, some cities offer shorter races for some.

London holds the largest marathon, and is the most popular spot for groups. Among other 
cities holding marathons are Berlin, Paris, Rome, Stockholm, Vienna, Brussels, 
Budapest, Munich, Bangkok and Tel Aviv.</SUM>

The men's division of the Barcelona 1992 will be contested tomorrow. It will be timed so 
that race's end will coincide with prime time television viewing. The marathon will be 
run in the late afternoon heat and humidity, and not in the usual early morning hours. The 
last four kilometers of the course will take the runners up a steep grade to the stadium.

The women's marathon was contested last Saturday at the same hour and under the 
similar conditions. Some contestants were senseless and had to be carried in on 
stretchers. Some marathon officials have openly criticized the cruel conditions.</SUM>
