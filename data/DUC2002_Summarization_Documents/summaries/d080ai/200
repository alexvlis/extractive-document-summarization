The longest, costliest, criminal trial in American history, the McMartin Pre-School 
molestation case, ended Thursday.  The jury acquitted Raymond Buckey and his mother, 
Peggy McMartin Buckey, on 52 counts and deadlocked on 13.  The case began in 1983 
and became a frenetic witch-hunt led by the California media.  At one time, seven 
defendants, 135 charges, and over 400 children were involved.  

Following the verdict, defendants wept, while parents decried the system for failing their 
children.  The judge was not surprised.  Jurors faulted the children's videotaped 
interviews, saying the interviewer asked leading questions.  Jurors believed some may 
have been molested, but the prosecution failed to prove the defendants responsible.  The 
therapist conducting the interviews defended her technique.  The current and former Los 
Angles district attorneys blamed each other and denied their ambitions influenced the 
case.  The pre-school's neighbors were disappointed and concerned about the building.

Reverberations will continue.  Several books and television movies are planned, although 
the response of the networks is not known.  Two civil suits by former defendants are 
underway and Mrs. Buckey said she plans to sue.  Parents of the children may decide to 
file civil charges because the burden proof is lower. A harassed minister seeks disability
