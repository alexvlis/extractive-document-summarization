The collapse of the Soviet Union was accompanied by major civil unrest and ethnic 
conflict in the former republics.  The Caucasus, Baltic and Central Asian republics all 
experienced unrest.  The reasons for the strife included nationalism, ethnic tensions and 
old grievances.  One of the most serious conflicts was in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of 
Azerbaijan.  The majority of the population there is Armenian and wanted unification 
with Armenia, Azerbaijan refused.  The conflict between the Azeris and the Armenians 
has existed for centuries.  Other conflicts were a direct result of the breakup of the Soviet 
Union.  In Moldova, the ethnic Romanian majority wanted to establish Moldova, which is 
close to Romanian as the official language.  The Russian minority dissented and 
demanded its own autonomous republic.  The Baltic republics wanted to be independent 
nations and many nationalities were demanding the return of lands taken from them 
under Stalin.  Gorbachev tried to hold the Soviet Union together through tougher 
legislation and by appeals for support for his reforms.  Following the collapse of the 
Soviet Union there was even an attempt at peacekeeping in Georgia, using Russian and 
Georgian troops.  There was even one call for an international peacekeeping mission in 
some of the hotspots.</SUM>
