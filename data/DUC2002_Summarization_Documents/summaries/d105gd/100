The collapse of the Soviet Union was accompanied by major civil unrest and ethnic 
conflict in the former republics.  The Caucasus, Baltic and Central Asian republics all 
experienced unrest.  The reasons for the strife included nationalism, ethnic tensions and 
old grievances.  One of the most serious conflicts was in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of 
Azerbaijan.  The majority of the population is Armenian and wanted unification with 
Armenia.  The Baltic republics wanted to be independent and many nationalities were 
demanding the return of lands taken from them under Stalin. In Moldova, the ethnic 
Romanian majority wanted to establish Moldavian as the official language.</SUM>
