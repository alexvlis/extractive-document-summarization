Mikail Gorbachev proposed tougher legislation to punish Soviets who
kindle ethnic unrest, saying "nationalist passions" benefit opponents
of his reforms.  State-run media indicated that a crackdown had begun
against the people of Armenia who continue to agitate for annexation
of a mostly Armenian enclave in the neighboring republic of
Azerbaijan.  The six-month conflict between the two republics over the
Nagorno- Karabakh district has let to ethnic violence.  Gorbachev said
the grounds for tougher legislation come from the Soviet constitution,
which says it is unlawful to advocate "racial or national
exclusiveness, hostility or contempt".  Gorbachev made other proposals
to increase power for each of the 15 republics.</SUM>

Mikail Gorbachev warned the nation that the country's growing ethnic
strife is endangering its unity as a state as well as threatening his
program of political and economic reform.  With serious ethnic clashes
and unrest in several Soviet republics and with nationalism growing
stronger in the Baltic republics, Gorbachev is struggling to hold the
Soviet Union together while pushing broad reforms.  Nearly 300 people
have been killed in clashes in the past two years.  Much of the strife
is rooted in past Soviet policies of domination by ethnic Russians or
in the forced deportation of thousands during the Stalinist era.</SUM>

The Soviet government has decided to give ethnic Germans and Crimean
Tatars who were expelled from their homelands by Stalin their own
autonomous region.  Since others now occupy their lands and houses,
the resettlement could take up to 10 years.  Trouble has already
broken out between ethnic Germans and Russians along the Volga River.
There are some 500,000 Crimean Tatars and 2 million ethnic Germans in
the Soviet Union.  A wave of 100,00 Germans emigrated to West Germany,
but many would stay if they could be assured of their own republic.
Stalin believed that the Tatars and Germans could not be trusted in
strategic areas.</SUM>

Ethnic violence killed 148 people and wounded 885 in the Central
Republic of Kirghizia in the Soviet Union.  The clashes arose over a
land dispute between ethnic Kirghiz and Uzbeks, both Sunni Moslems.
In two years of civil strife, mainly ethnic clashes, 24,000 have been
arrested.  Troops had to be used in 13 regions of the Soviet Unions to
deal with the unrest.  Besides unrest in Kirghizia and Uzbekistan,
ethnic violence has also been reported in Georgia, Armenia,
Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Tadzhikistan.  These conflicts were often
accompanied by riots, arson and the massacre of innocent people.</SUM>

Moldova, acting to defuse one of the Soviet union's most explosive
ethnic conflicts, agreed to comply with a Kremlin order to reconsider
its law making Moldavian the republic's official language.  Gorbachev
gave the republic 10 days to dissolve a new national guard and to
establish measures guaranteeing equal rights for all ethnic groups
within its borders.  Unrest has griped Moldava, a largely agricultural
republic bordering Romania, during its push for independence from the
Soviet Union.  Alarmed by rising Moldavian nationalism and declaring
they are discriminated against by Moldavans, two of the republic's
minority groups have begun their own separatist movements.</SUM>

Troops of the former Soviet Union were ordered out of the Armenian
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh after Armenian and Azeri militants fired
on them. The enclave is administered by Azerbaijan, but largely
inhabited by Armenians.  Armenians in the enclave want unification
with Armenia, but Azerbaijan refuses to give up the territory.  The
commander of the Soviet troops has long warned that he would pull out
troops rather than to allow them to become the targets of ethnic
conflicts.  Troops under fire along the Armenian-Azerbaijan border
will also be withdrawn.  Azeri and Armenian officials say that
guerrillas on both sides of the conflict are using sophisticated
weapons.</SUM>

A ceasefire in Moldova was threatened when a truck driver transporting
militiamen was killed by machinegun fire in the self-proclaimed Trans
Dnestr republic, home of the Russian-speaking minority.  The ceasefire
was between the Moldavan authroities, dominated by ethnic Romanians,
and the so-called Trans Dnestr republic.  The conflict, stems directly
from the breakup of the Soviet Union, unlike the more serious strife
in Nagorno-Karabakh where tension between Azeris and Armenians has
existed for centuries.  Moldava came under Soviet control in 1944 and
the Soviet government sought to stifle any links with Romania.
Ukrainians and Russians together represent 27% of the population and
Moldavans 64%.</SUM>

Russia and Georgia deployed peacekeeping troops to stop ethnic
fighting in the disputed region of South Ossetia, which is part of
Georgia, in the first peacekeeping operation since the collapse of the
Soviet Union.  The disintegration of the Soviet Union has prompted
waves of bloodletting in ethnic flashpoints from Romania to the Afghan
border.  Russia and Georgia were cautiously optimistic that Ossetia
could be the first region of the former Soviet Union where armed
conflict could be resolved with the help of "political measures and
actions".  The peacekeepers' mission is to form a physical barrier
between the two sides, opening the way for future talks.</SUM>

Three thousand Russian Special Forces flew to the Caucasus region to
halt ethnic fighting in North Ossetia.  Russian President Yeltsin sent
the elite units to stop the fighting between Ossetians and another
ethnic group, the Ingush.  Scores were reported killed or injured.
The Ingush are demanding the return of lands expropriated by Stalin in
1944.  The Russian action mirrored recent developments in the former
Soviet Republic of Tajikistan, where Russian troops have also been
deployed.  The Caucasus Mountains, are engulfed in several conflicts.
Among them are Georgia's war with Abkazian separatists, and
Azerbaijan's conflict with ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh.</SUM>

The international community is becoming increasingly aware of the true
magnitude of ethnic and political conflicts in the former Soviet
Union.  Russia is concerned about conflicts close to its borders,
about the safety of ethnic Russians living in those areas and about
refugees fleeing to Russia.  They argue that the international
community should undertake peacekeeping missions in these areas as
they have in other hotspots.  These areas should be of concern to the
international community both for humanitarian reasons and because they
risk provoking regional instability.  If such peacekeeping missions
are undertaken, respect for the sovereignty of the newly independent
countries must remain paramount.</SUM>

The Tajik Communist Party has called for the restoration of a
renovated Soviet Union in the form of a federation as the only means
to ensure the development of the political, economic and spiritual
potential of the former Soviet republics.  They claim that the
disintegration of the Soviet Union and the parade of sovereignty that
followed have led to economic and political chaos.  Tajikistan was
very hard hit by the wave of ethnic conflict and general unrest that
occurred when the Soviet Union collapsed.  The civil war in the
republic claimed over 100,000 lives.  The Party says the majority of
Tajiks support such a restoration.</SUM>

Viktor Alksnis, born in Latvia in 1950 and former deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the 
former USSR is warning of possible ethnic cleansing in Latvia.  He says that the adoption 
of the Latvian citizenship law violates not only human rights but creates the conditions 
for a conflict similar to the ones in Yugoslavia and the Caucasus.  This law allows for a 
"mild" ethnic cleansing of the Russian-speaking population of Latvia. According to 
Alksnis, some circles in Moscow want conflict in Latvia and will use the "mild" Russian 
cleansing as an excuse for stringent ethnic cleansing of the Latvians.</SUM>
