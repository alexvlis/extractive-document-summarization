Firing indiscriminately on the crowds as they advanced, Chinese troops broke through 
barricades of reform-minded protesters late on 3 June1989 and reached Tiananmen 
Square after being rebuffed in earlier attempts. Early the next day they routed the 
surviving demonstrators who fled the square that had occupied for three weeks in 
defiance of government orders. Thousands died in the two days of violence. The bloody 
weekend was the climax of trouble that had escalated since April.

Later demonstrations in other large Chinese cities protested the Beijing slaughter. The 
United States suspended all military sales to China.</SUM>
