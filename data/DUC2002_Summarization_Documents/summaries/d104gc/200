Late on Saturday evening, 3 June 1989, Chinese troops broke through barricades on 
streets leading to Tiananmen Square. The soldiers fired indiscriminately on the crowds as 
they scattered resisters. The troops had previously been unsuccessful in reaching the 
square. By noon on 4 June the troops had crushed the demonstrators for political reform 
and forced them to flee the square they had occupied for three weeks in defiance of  
government orders issued under martial law. The army soon removed evidence of the 
protest , including the student-built replica of the Statue of Liberty.

The bloody weekend was the climax of trouble that had been escalating since April. It 
had grown tense, but largely peaceful during the three weeks prior to 3 June.

The government insisted that only 300 were killed. The Chinese Red Cross said 3,600 
died and 60,000 were injured. Most of those killed on 3 and 4 June fell in streets leading 
to Tiananmen.

Demonstrations in Shanghai, Nanjing, and other large Chinese cities on 5 June protested 
the slaughter in Beijing. The United States suspended all military sales to China. Many 
foreign embassies urged their citizens to leave Beijing.</SUM>
