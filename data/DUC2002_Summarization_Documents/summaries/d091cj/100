The violent thunderstorms that struck central and eastern Ohio Thursday left twenty-one 
dead, 14 missing, and dozens homeless. Two creeks outside Shadyside overflowed in the 
heavy rain. Authorities said dams formed by debris at bridges broke under the water 
pressure, creating a "wall of water." Homes were knocked off their foundations and a 
Shadyside bar was swept away. Dog teams assisted in the search for victims. The 
National Weather Service had not issued a flood warning before the disaster.

Gov. Celeste declared a state of emergency. The Federal Emergency Management 
Agency will open an office in Shadyside to accept applications for aid.</SUM>
