The death toll from last week's floods reached 21 today when a body was pulled from the 
Ohio River. Hope is fading that the 14 people still listed as missing are alive. 

Violent thunderstorms swept through central and eastern Ohio Thursday night. The 
Wegee and Pipe creeks outside the Ohio River village Shadyside overflowed when about 
4 inches of rain fell in about an hour. Authorities said dams formed by debris at bridges 
broke under the water pressure, creating a "wall of water." Homes were knocked off their 
foundations and a bar in Shadyside was swept away. In Licking and Jefferson counties, 
about 200 people were evacuated from their homes. Many residents recounted stories of 
narrow escapes and lost property.

Few people carried flood insurance, and homeowners' insurance will not cover the 
damage. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will open an office in Shadyside 
to accept applications for aid. The National Weather Service said a flood watch, but not a 
warning, was issued before the disaster.

Gov. Richard Celeste declared a state of emergency. The Shadyside Fire Department 
established a command center at the Jefferson Elementary School to coordinate rescue 
efforts. Authorities said dog teams assisted in the search for victims.</SUM>
