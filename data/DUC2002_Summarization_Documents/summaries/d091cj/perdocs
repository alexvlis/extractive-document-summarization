Kerri Trigg who was playing in a friend's house when it was washed away in a flash 
flood that swept through Shadyside Thursday night is one of nearly three dozen still 
missing two days later. Searchers for the missing used dogs to sniff through the rubble 
and for five miles south of town along the banks of the Wegee and Pipe creeks. Workers 
also searched the debris around the Hannibal locks and dam, 25 miles south of town.

Kerri's friend, Amber Colvin, was swept down Wegee Creek and into the Ohio River, but 
survived a seven-mile ordeal by clinging to logs.</SUM>

Signs of the devastation wrought by the flash flood that hit the outskirts of Shadyside 
Thursday night are everywhere. Cement blocks are all that remain of some homes; fallen 
branches stand where trees used to be; cars are mired in roof-deep mud, and guardrails 
and chunks of concrete have been torn from roads. 

Five inches of rain fell in 3 hours, churning floodwaters that left at least 11 people dead 
and 51 others missing early today. 

At least 170 members of the Ohio National Guard were summoned to patrol and help 
rebuild the roads, said an Ohio Emergency Management Agency spokesperson.</SUM>

Four more bodies were found Sunday (one in Pipe Creek about seven miles south of 
Shadyside, one along Wegee Creek, and two in the Ohio River), bringing the death toll 
from flash floods that swept through eastern Ohio on Thursday to 20. Sixteen people are 
still missing. National Guard Capt. Jim Boling said 23 dog teams were searching for 
victims.

The Wegee and Pipe creeks overflowed when 5 inches of rain fell in 3 hours. Shadyside 
Fire Chief Mark Badia said rainwater running down hillsides forced debris into the 
creeks, forming dams at bridges. The "dams" broke under the water pressure.</SUM>

The death toll from last week's floods reached 21 today when a body was pulled from the 
Ohio River. Hope is fading that the 14 people still listed as missing are alive. The search 
for the missing was suspended briefly this morning when rain fell for about 45 minutes, 
swelling Wegee Creek, one of the two creeks that overflowed in Thursday night's flash 
flood. 

Few people in the area carried flood insurance, and homeowners' insurance will not 
cover the flood damage. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will open an 
office Tuesday in Shadyside to accept application for low-interest loans and grants.</SUM>

On Sunday searchers in the rural area of eastern Ohio found a body in debris along 
Wegee Creek and extracted two from the Ohio River, bringing the death toll from flash 
floods that swept through the area last Thursday to19. Eighteen people are still missing. 
As many as 70 houses were destroyed.

Investigators Sunday blamed the flash floods on an unusually heavy rainstorm that 
overwhelmed the designed flow capacities of three bridges over the Wegee and Pipe 
creeks. Rainwater running down hillsides forced debris into the creeks, forming dams at 
each bridge. The "dams" broke under the water pressure.</SUM>
