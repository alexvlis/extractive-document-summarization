<LEADPARA>  PEOPLE in this picture-postcard town of Victorian houses and clean streets
don't care what Jay Leno or the polls or the Democrats or disgruntled
Republicans have been saying about Dan Quayle.;    Despite the fact that
President Bush's health problems have made the vice president a national
preoccupation, to people here he's just Danny Quayle from Polk Street -- a
really nice guy from a really nice family that runs the local newspaper.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     He is the most important person ever to come out of this town, and even as
the world considers his fitness for the presidency, Huntington is celebrating
his life in what is ambitiously being billed as the Premiere Dan Quayle
Memorabilia Exhibit.;    To those who say Quayle does not merit his own
exhibition, Quayle devotees say with a mixture of defiance and dignity that he
is, after all, the vice president of the United States.;    "We're preserving
history," says David Schenkel, the exhibition coordinator. "A century from now
someone may want to do a dissertation on him.";    If so, Huntington will be
ready.;    Relatives, former classmates and longtime neighbors of Quayle have
donated yearbooks, report cards, poems, letters, his Little League uniform, a
coffee cup he drank from, a chair he once stood on during the 1988
presidential campaign and just about anything else he ever touched, wrote,
signed or posed for.;    The vice president's mother, Corinne, donated a lock
of his baby hair. The 1972 Indianapolis 500 queen produced a picture of
Quayle, then an aide to Indiana Gov. Edgar Whitcomb, accompanying her to the
race. And a former housekeeper turned in a 20-year-old piece of carpeting she
saved from one of Quayle's floors.;    The exhibition, which runs through May
20, was put together by the Dan Quayle Commemorative Foundation, a sort of
fan-club-turned-archive devoted to documenting the life and times of the
nation's 44th and, they say, least-understood vice president.;    "He has
taken such a bad rap," said Schenkel, a foundation board member. "If people
knew him, they'd see he's a regular person. If they had a chance to sit down
with Dan as a neighbor, they would see the extremely good values in the man.";
   These are the faithful, who have long since stopped expecting "good press"
on their man. Instead they measure news reports on him by their relative
negativity, describing the best coverage as "more upbeat" or "halfway
decent.";    They defend the relatively young age of Quayle, who turned 44 in
February ("All he needs is a little seasoning"); his limited experience ("Look
at what they said about Truman -- he was a haberdasher"), and his passion for
golf ("He has to have some form of relaxation"). But they are careful not to
stretch the superlatives. The description "nice" comes up a lot.;    "He's not
the fool that the talk show hosts think he is," says Dottie Watson, president
of the Republican Women of Huntington County. "He's a very nice person, a
capable person. Everybody I know says he can do it.";    That is not to say
some people don't have some friendly advice for Quayle. "If he would slow
down, talk an octave lower and think about what he's saying, I don't think
people would take him the way they do," said Jean Anne Drabenstot, the owner
of Nick's Kitchen, Quayle's favorite restaurant.;    Hayden Schenkel, chairman
of the Huntington County Democratic Party and a distant cousin of David
Schenkel, says, "Some people would shudder and shiver if he accidentally
became president of the United States. Most of the Democrats and even some of
the Republicans would say they're tickled to death to have him as vice
president, and they're 100 percent behind him. But in all due respect, we sure
hope nothing happens to President Bush.";    Quayle has declined an invitation
to attend the tribute, citing a busy schedule. Nonetheless, most of
Huntington's 17,000 residents have rallied around their native son for the
exhibition, which tracks his life from infancy through law school, from the
Senate to the vice presidency.;    The free exhibition has turned a gray room
in the town's public library into a virtual Dan Quayle museum. The display
patches together pieces of a life that until the last decade was strikingly
ordinary.;    There is Dan Quayle and his brother Chris riding horseback and
wearing cowboy hats, or sitting in front of the fireplace in their pajamas at
Christmas. There is Dan Quayle with his Vacation Bible School class, Dan
Quayle with the high school golf team, Dan Quayle at 5 or 6 years of age with
Sharon McEachern when they were named king and queen of the swim festival at
the Fort Wayne Country Club. It is all very 50s, very Middle American, almost
surreal in its innocence.;    There are windows into the workings of the
Quayle family, too. For example, his father, James, signed the report cards
when Dan brought home poor grades, and his mother signed when he brought home
good ones.;    And there are letters and poems that he wrote, which only go to
show that one does not have to be a Yeats to make it in politics. Dan wrote
this rather thoughtful verse on Nov. 22, 1960, when he was 13 years old:;   
My Dad is very very nice;    But he is not made of sugar and spice.;   
Sometimes he acts as if he has been disturbed;    But at other times he is as
cheerful as a bird.;    The exhibit also includes the 1972 newspaper
announcement of Dan and Marilyn Quayle's wedding, the wooden "Quayle &amp; Quayle"
shingle the couple hung when they opened their law practice here, and assorted
campaign souvenirs, including the official air sickness bag from the 1988
Republican National Convention.;    Ultimately, the foundation wants to build
a repository for the memorabilia. It has already organized a walking tour of
historic Quayle sites, like the white, ranch-style house where he spent his
early days, and Nick's Kitchen, where he likes to order tenderloins, fries and
a milkshake.;    "We want everybody to know he's a winner -- I don't care what
the newspapers say," said Marge Hiner, one of the exhibit organizers. "What a
role model for our children, to know that you can be a normal person, come
from a normal family and become vice president of the United States."  </TEXT>
