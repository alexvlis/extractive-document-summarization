   Dan Quayle is likely to be a ``man on the
outside'' in George Bush's White House following a vice presidential
candidacy that began in a furor but settled into obscurity, experts
say.
   Encumbered by his image as a political novice who needed a bevy
of professional handlers to survive early campaign controversies,
Quayle enters a Bush administration in which he has few intimates or
allies.
   Relegated in the campaign to small towns and safe GOP areas,
Quayle as vice president is likely to be given a traditional
ceremonial role _ going to political gatherings and state funerals _
rather than the advisory role that Walter Mondale and even Bush had,
some scholars feel.
   ``Dan Quayle is going to set the vice presidency back about a
decade or more. One thing that political scientists have been
talking about is just how much the vice presidency has grown. ...
With Quayle, it's just going to retreat to the old days of politics
and funerals,'' said Ryan Barilleaux, a professor of political
science at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, who studies the
American presidency.
   Bush rarely mentioned his 41-year-old running mate during the
campaign. When asked, Bush employed the stock lines that Quayle
would ``make an outstanding vice president'' and had been ``tempered
by steel'' as he weathered the early furor over his military
service, academic record and personal life.
   The president-elect told reporters Quayle would have access to
the same papers, information and intelligence that is available to
the president. But he would go no further in describing what
assignments he would give Quayle.
   Quayle says Bush has talked to him about heading a space council,
and that he assumes he'll have a role in the administration's
anti-drug efforts. ``I will be a very close adviser to the
president,'' Quayle said.
   But that's not the way everyone sees it.
   Both Bush and Mondale came to their vice presidential campaigns
with substantial reputations and were able to place key staffers in
important positions in the respective presidential campaigns,
Barilleaux notes.
   ``Dan Quayle has contributed nothing in the way of staff to the
Bush campaign. He doesn't have his own big reputation on Capitol
Hill. ... Dan Quayle has no friends in a Bush White House except
George Bush,'' Barilleaux says.
   ``They're going to give him a lot of window dressing, a space
council, drug task force, but he's going to be a man on the outside
... not a man who's going to be consulted in a crisis, except on a
pro forma basis.''
   But Eddie Mahe Jr., a GOP consultant who worked with the Bush
campaign, says Bush is likely to give Quayle a more active role in
the administration than he had in the campaign.
   ``Vindication demands that. Both of them will want to prove how
right the decision was,'' Mahe says.
   Democrats portrayed Quayle during the campaign as a lightweight,
a man with little or no legislative accomplishments, untested and
unqualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. Even some
members of Quayle's own party were dismayed at Bush's choice.
   Quayle didn't help his case by making a number of celebrated
gaffes during the campaign, perhaps the worst being his garbled
explanation of the Holocaust and his declaration, ``I didn't live in
this century.''
   Norman Ornstein, of the American Enterprise Institute, says
Quayle, while ``not the world's leading intellectual,'' is not ``a
complete dummy.'' He was simply thrust into a situation for which he
was unprepared, Ornstein says.
   ``I think he's immature. He's not stupid,'' Ornstein says.
   But Quayle comes to the White House with ``a very damaging
stereotype that's developed about him that's widely believed in the
political community and that's believed by a large segment of the
electorate,'' Ornstein says.
   ``That's going to give him a good deal to overcome. It's going to
give him an enormous impetus to prove himself. That's going to be
difficult, given the office.''
   Both Barilleaux and Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution see
parallels in Quayle's vice presidency and those of Richard Nixon and
Spiro Agnew. The choice of Nixon was viewed as a move by Dwight
Eisenhower to appease the party's right wing, and Agnew was seen as
a political nonentity.
   ``The natural response is to use him (Quayle) sparingly, as Nixon
did with Agnew in 1968,'' Hess says. ``However, Quayle has four
years to prove himself, and I think you're going to see stories in
two years about how much he's learned, how much he's acted
responsibly, how far he's come from the campaign of 1988.''
   Quayle admits the campaign was a learning process. After the
controversies subsided, Quayle declared his independence from his
Bush handlers, saying he would be his own man. He became more
accessible to the media but continued to adhere to the schedule
handed down from Washington and to deliver the party's scripted
message. Soon, he dropped off the front pages.
   And although he occasionally spoke out in frustration at having
little control over his schedule and at ceasing to make national
news, he played the role of loyal No. 2 and even trumpeted his new
anonymity.
   ``We have arrived as being a traditional vice presidential
nominee because we are either on the back pages or either not on the
pages at all. That's what we're supposed to be,'' he told reporters.
   That willingness to be a team player could serve him well in a
Bush White House, Mahe feels, since Bush wants ``a private adviser,
whose experience and opinion he respected ... (who) has never had
another agenda.''
   ``Dan Quayle owes his political life to one man and one man
alone,'' Mahe says. ``You're never going to see Dan Quayle telling
tales out of school.''
