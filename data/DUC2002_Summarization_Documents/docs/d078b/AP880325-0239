   What do Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo, Cary
Grant, Alfred Hitchcock and Steven Spielberg have in common? They
have never won Academy Awards for their individual achievements.
   Such flagrant omissions are often cited by critics as evidence
of the unfairness of Hollywood's highest prize. Oscar's 60-year
history is filled with examples of the film world's highest
achievers being overlooked by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences.
   The latest casualties are directors James L. Brooks, whose movie
``Broadcast News'' was nominated though he wasn't, and Spielberg
who was left out in the cold with his ``Empire of the Sun.''
   Although ``Broadcast News'' won seven major nominations,
including best picture and three acting categories, Brooks was
strangely overlooked by the Academy's directing branch.
   Since no movie has ever won a best picture Oscar without its
director at least being nominated, the chances of the once-favored
``Broadcast News'' to be a big winner at the awards ceremony on
April 11 have been significantly reduced.
   Brooks did better in 1984 when his ``Terms of Endearment'' took
the lion's share of Oscars, including best picture and director.
   Spielberg's ``Empire of the Sun'' won six nominations this year,
none of them major and none for director. Two years ago, ``The
Color Purple'' received 11 nominations but not for him as director.
The Directors Guild nevertheless named him best director that year.
   ``I'm floored by this,'' Spielberg said upon receiving his DGA
award. ``This is the last thing I expected to happen. ... If some
of you are making a statement _ thank God _ I thank you for that.''
   Why the Spielberg slight? Some observers cite the fact that only
257 directors nominate for the Academy Awards, and many are
veterans who might not look kindly on the young man whose films are
the biggest moneymakers in history (``Jaws,'' ``E.T.,'' ``Raiders
of the Lost Ark'').
   The Academy appeared to make amends last year by presenting
Spielberg with the Irving Thalberg award for ``consistently high
quality of production.'' There was no mention of the fact that
Spielberg is primarily a director, not a producer.
   The Thalberg award has come in handy to acknowledge giants who
were overlooked for individual awards. The recipients have included
Cecil B. DeMille, Stanley Kramer, Alfred Hitchcock, Ingmar Bergman
and Mervyn Leroy.
   The honorary award has also proved useful to salve the Academy's
conscience. Charlie Chaplin received one at the first Academy
Awards for his creation of ``The Circus'' and again at the 44th
awards for ``the incalculable effect he has had in making motion
pictures the art form of this century.''
   Douglas Fairbanks, Judy Garland, Noel Coward, Ernst Lubitsch,
Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Harold Lloyd, Greta Garbo, Maurice
Chevalier, Stan Laurel, Cary Grant, Lillian Gish, Edward G.
Robinson, Groucho Marx, Howard Hawks and Jean Renoir are others who
have received honorary awards.
   Cary Grant once remarked that he never expected to win an
Academy Award. ``I'd have to blacken my teeth first,'' he quipped,
alluding to the Academy's fondness for actors who portray bums and
downtrodden characters.
   Alfred Hitchcock also had a lighthearted comment on why he
failed to win an Oscar: ``I suppose it was a matter of
carelessness.''
   The overlooking of classic films and the industry's most
talented filmmakers has provided historians with cause for dispute.
   For example, ``Citizen Kane,'' which customarily places No. 1 on
polls of the greatest American films, was nominated in 1941 for
best picture (there were 10 nominees in those days), for Orson
Welles' performance, direction and co-scripting with Herman
Mankiewicz, Gregg Toland's camera work, plus art direction, sound,
music and editing.
   The only Oscar for ``Citizen Kane'' was for the script. ``How
Green Was My Valley'' was named best picture.
   Billy Wilder's classic comedy, ``Some Like It Hot,'' failed to
be nominated as best picture, as did Chaplin's ``Modern Times,''
Hawks' ``Red River'' and Woody Allen's ``Manhattan.''
   Oh, well. Oscar might use Joe E. Brown's final line from ``Some
Like It Hot'': ``Nobody's perfect.''
