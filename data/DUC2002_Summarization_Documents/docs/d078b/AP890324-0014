   Free enterprise has collided with the Academy
Awards, and everybody's trying to pick up the pieces.
   With Oscar statuettes selling at auction for more than $10,000
and a Chicago trophy company casting alleged Academy Award clones,
the National Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is
scrambling to make sure Oscar's golden sheen isn't tarnished by
Hollywood hucksterism.
   ``If you know about an infringement and fail to object to it, you
risk having your trademark become public domain,'' said Bruce Davis,
the Academy's executive administrator, in explaining the lawsuits
the organization has filed to protect its beloved hunk of
electroplated pewter.
   But despite the Academy's crusade against crass commercialism,
this year's awards ceremony will feature a new merchandising
wrinkle: Some 800 limousines delivering the most famous stars to the
Oscar telecast will be equipped with door-mounted coolers jammed
with Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Classic and other Coca-Cola Co. beverages.
   When the limo doors swing open in front of the Shrine Auditorium
and the celebrities tumble out, the Coke logo will be on display in
front of an audience that includes millions around the world.
   ``It seemed like a good marketing opportunity,'' said Coca-Cola
spokesman Ira Gleser. ``The Academy approached our local bottler in
Los Angeles and said we're going to have a lot of thirsty people.''
   But even as the Academy embraces this new intrusion of
merchandising, it has lashed out at whatever else it considers a
blemishing of the Oscar name.
   When MGM-UA, the distributor of ``Rain Man,'' published newspaper
advertisements touting the film's Oscar nominations before the
nominations were even announced, the Academy issued a harsh
statement condemning MGM-UA's promotional gamble. After the ads
appeared, ``Rain Man'' collected nine nominations.
   ``We regard this as a serious matter, and we have communicated
our concern,'' said Richard Kahn, president of the Academy.
   For nearly 50 years, the Academy has maintained strict security
around both the nominations and the award winners. It also has
envisoned the statuette itself as something of an icon.
   So auctioning the Oscar has greatly distressed the Academy.
   The Collector's Book Store, local sponsors of monthly
entertainment memorabilia auctions, has sold off seven Oscars in the
past year, including the best picture trophy for 1951's ``An
American in Paris'' ($15,760), Marlon Brando's best actor prize for
1954's ``On the Waterfront'' ($13,000) and the black and white
interior decoration Oscar for 1941's ``How Green Was My Valley''
($17,715).
   None were sold by the original recipients; heirs or friends who
had later received the trophies put them on the block.
   When Malcolm Willits, the book store's owner, announced that he
would hold a February auction for the 1957 best-picture trophy for
``Around the World in 80 Days,'' the Academy said enough, initiating
a court action that, for now, has blocked any future trophy sales.
   The Academy insists that a contract signed by Oscar winners
mandates that they will not sell the trophies without first offering
them to the Academy for a nominal fee.
   ``But now that the word is out that these awards are worth
$10,000 to $50,000, people are reluctant to sell them back to the
Academy for $10,'' Willits said.
   ``The Academy has created something of great value here. This is
the most famous award in the world _ the most instantly recognizable
award. The Nobel Prize might be a greater honor, but people know
more about what an Academy Award looks like.
   ``And they're very limited, too. There's not too many of them
around. ... Twenty years ago, you wouldn't have a movie poster in
your living room unless you were a college student. Now, you can go
into Beverly Hills homes and there's a movie poster, and the darn
thing's worth $10,000 or $20,000 dollars.''
   When the Academy won a court order temporarily blocking future
auctions, Willits decided to sell his store. ``It seemed to be the
final straw. I don't like lawsuits,'' he said. ``I'm getting older
and I'd like to write movie scripts.''
   Yet the Academy has lost its most recent attempt to save its
trophy's integrity: A copyright infringement suit brought against
the Houston International Film Festival was dismissed March 16 in a
California federal court.
   The Academy had claimed the Lone Star Statuette, designed and
built by Chicago's Creative House Promotions, was ``practically
identical'' to the Oscar. The court found otherwise.
