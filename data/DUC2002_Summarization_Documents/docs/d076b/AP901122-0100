   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's international
admirers praised her courage and achievements Thursday after she
announced she would resign. Even her foes tempered scorn with
praise for a formidable adversary.
   Said President Bush, ``I will miss her.''
   He called her ``an outstanding ally of the United States,''
adding, ``You always knew where she was and what she believed.''
   Vitaly Ignatenko, spokesman for Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev, told the independent Interfax news agency: ``Political,
economic and cultural ties between our countries have become of
greater importance'' in the Thatcher era. ``Our relations ... were
marked by constructivism and dialogue.''
   The reluctance Mrs. Thatcher showed toward increasing European
unity was the source of most criticism. But in a joyful and
unambiguous response, Iraq saw the Persian Gulf crisis as cause of
her downfall.
   Bitterness was undisguised in the comment from Argentina's
Nicanor Costa Mendez, foreign minister during his country's 1982
Falklands War with Britain.
   ``I can't say that it makes me sad,'' he said. ``I believe that
the extreme positions - unnecessarily extreme, unjustifiably
extreme - of the prime minister were one of the causes of the war,
and one of the biggest impediments to achieve agreement after.''
   Socialist President Mario Soares of Portugal singled out ``her
systematic opposition to the advances of the European Community.''
   ``During her long mandate,'' he said, ``the preoccupations of
social justice receded many times before purely development
objectives, causing a climate of discontent in British public
opinion to which Mrs. Thatcher appeared insensitive.''
   But Soares also lauded the British prime minister as a
``determined politician (who) took courageous positions on critical
occasions in international life and without doubt marked an era in
the contemporary history of her country.''
   German Finance Minister Theo Waigel noted, ``Despite her
critical position on some questions of European integration, she
accomplished a great deal for European politics.''
   A neutral letter from Socialist President Francois Mitterrand of
France told Mrs. Thatcher she had ``marked an important moment in
the history of your country and that of Europe.''
   Iraqi government spokesman Naji al-Hadithi said growing
opposition to her hard line against Iraq over its invasion of
Kuwait ``buried Mrs. Thatcher'' just as the 1956 crisis over
Britain's attack on the Suez Canal ruined former Prime Minister
Anthony Eden.
   Britain stepped in after Egypt nationalized the canal.
   On Thursday, Britain announced it was nearly doubling its troops
deployed in the gulf as part of the multinational force arrayed
against Iraq, sending 14,000 more soldiers to join the 16,000
already in the region.
   South African President F.W. de Klerk praised Mrs. Thatcher, who
opposed sanctions on South Africa, for standing up to world
pressure and standing by Pretoria.
   ``She had faith in South Africa's ability to solve its problems
in a democratic way ... She had the courage of her convictions,''
he said.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel saidafter hearing of
her resignation that Israel ``feels a moment of sorrow because we
all know this special personality, Mrs. Thatcher, who did many
things and was an outstanding leader.''
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan said the British prime
minister ``is a rare leader of firm convictions who was invigorated
the United Kingdom and I feel great regret that she has withdrawn
from the front line.''
   Belgium's prime minister, Wilfried Martens, applauded ``the
determining role she played during more than 10 years in her own
country and on the international scene.''
   Said Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia, ``Even those like
myself who have been at odds with Margaret Thatcher on particular
issues have admired her courage and tenacity of purpose.
   ``Whatever the forces arrayed against her, she was always
prepared to pursue with the utmost vigor those positions in which
she believed.''
   Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers said, ``In the many years that
she placed such an important stamp on the policies of the United
Kingdom, Mrs. Thatcher has shown that she does not avoid making
difficult decisions that she deems to be in the nation's interest.
This, too, is such a decision which deserves respect.''
   Former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, now a
legislator in the European Parliament, said Mrs. Thatcher's
decision to quit was ``dignified and courageous.''
   ``Margaret Thatcher will be seen with Winston Churchill as the
greatest British prime minister of the last 50 years. The curtain
has fallen on the Iron Lady. She deserves our congratulations.''
   Even European Commission President Jacques Delors, Mrs.
Thatcher's archenemy in Europe, spoke of his ``high esteem'' for
her, despite their differences.
   Alfred Dregger, parliamentary leader of Germany's governing
Christian Democratic Union, said Mrs. Thatcher played a major role
in securing Western solidarity in the ``historical conflict for
freedom and democracy. We thank her for that.''
   Former President Reagan spoke with great warmth of his closest
foreign ally.
   ``Margaret Thatcher's resoluteness played a key role in ending
the Cold War,'' he said. ``She stood up to the Soviets and let them
know she meant business. Her deep and abiding dedication to the
principles of liberty and democracy served as an inspiration to
oppressed peoples everywhere who knew that Margaret Thatcher would
never waver in her belief that all men and women are entitled to
live in freedom.''
