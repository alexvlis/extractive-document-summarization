President Bush lost an irreplaceable pin supporting his mission in the Persian 
Gulf on Thanksgiving Day. He heard the news of Margaret Thatcher's resignation 
as he celebrated the holiday in the Saudi desert -- and it clearly came as a 
shock. In the State Department, too, it came as a shock. Americans who had come 
to take Thatcher for granted during her 11 years of power were not prepared for 
her passing. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher had told the world that she would fight to a second ballot after her 
narrow failure to retain the premiership outright on Tuesday. The feeling 
everywhere was that Thatcher always stuck to her word. So no problem. Pass the 
turkey. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher's friends all over the world had reckoned without the British 
Conservative Party, which had looked at the opinion polls, the bad economic 
news and an unpopular new tax and smelled a loss at the next election. They had 
reckoned without the hatred for the flamboyant Michael Heseltine among the 
middle-ranking party figures who risked losing their jobs and future prospects 
if the unpredictable "Tarzan" came to power. 
</P>
<P>
It was an extraordinary scene in the palace of Westminster on Wednesday night 
as one by one her own Cabinet members trooped sheepishly into Thatcher's office 
and told her, in their chosen code, that they "couldn't support her over the 
weekend" in the second round of secret balloting on the party's leadership. 
Therefore, if Heseltine was to be beaten, it had to be by someone else. After 
"sleeping on it," as one of her closest advisers put it, Thatcher reluctantly 
concluded that she had to go. Thus did the toughest fighter for shared British 
and American values since Winston Churchill become the first prime minister to 
be forced out of office by the Conservative Party since the failed war leader 
Neville Chamberlain. 
</P>

When George Bush recovered from his Thanksgiving surprise, he was generous in 
his praise. Two years ago, his words would have rung hollow. The President 
began his term in office without much trust in her. He had seen the influence 
she exerted over Ronald Reagan and was keen to be seen as his own man. He had 
heard her doubts over the pace of German reunification and the integration of 
Europe, and had been persuaded by his advisers that she stood against the 
United States' best interests. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, however, that changed. At the beginning of the Persian Gulf crisis, 
the President deliberately sought Thatcher's analysis. It was her assessment of 
the threat to international security posed by Iraqi aggression that, according 
to British and American sources, set the moral framework for Operation Desert 
Shield. The pivotal moment was when she fielded press questions about Iraq on 
Bush's behalf in the Colorado mountain garden of the U.S. ambassador to 
Britain, Henry Catto; that marked the public turning point. She was able to 
articulate what Bush sensed was right. And he was able to defer to her without 
embarrassment, seeming almost gentlemanly in allowing her to go first. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is unlikely to reach such a rapport with any of her three potential 
successors. Heseltine is an exceptionally powerful orator, but it hard to see 
that helping the tongue-tied American President. Douglas Hurd, the urbane 
foreign secretary, is an English James Baker; the President already has a James 
Baker. John Major, the chancellor of the Exchequer and Thatcher's own choice to 
succeed her, may have views very close to Bush's. But he is mild-mannered, 
slightly clumsy and, although widely liked and admired by his friends, is 
almost wholly without international experience. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is no longer the Anglo-American "special relationship." It is 
Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan who will go down in history as Washington 
and London's "last romantics." They were the ones who would each ditch their 
closest friends in order to support the other: Reagan when overruling Jeane 
Kirkpatrick's objections to the Falklands campaign, and Thatcher when blocking 
her own right wing's protests at the U.S. bombing of Libya from British bases. 
They shared the conviction that communism could be rolled back -- and she 
helped persuade him that Mikhail Gorbachev was a man who could be trusted. The 
powerful enunciation of that belief -- and its eventual vindication -- may be 
the last great achievement of the special postwar Anglo-American alliance. 
</P>
<P>
George Bush and Margaret Thatcher had something more simple in common, a 
pragmatic relationship of mutual respect and support that benefited both. 
</P>
<P>
British policy toward Iraq will not change suddenly under a new prime minister. 
The doubling of the size of the British gulf force on Thursday attempted 
emphatically to prove that. But as time goes by, Britain's allies will find 
that many certainties have passed along with Margaret Thatcher. If seductive 
deals emerge to save the face and the atomic-weapon factories of Saddam 
Hussein, her steadfastness will be sorely missed. 
</P>
<P>
And if Europe becomes more inward-looking and protectionist, blame those who 
booted out the prime minister whose final words to her Cabinet were, "It's a 
funny old world." Her memoirs deserve a more dignified title.
