<LEADPARA>  The women's field for Sunday's San Francisco Marathon appears mighty
impressive to race President Rich Nichols, who didn't have to do much coaxing
to get the highly ranked women to enter.;    "This year's women's field is
interesting because most of the competitors called us," said Nichols. "We
didn't have to do the calling like we normally would have to."  </LEADPARA>

TOP WOMEN EAGER TO RUN IN S.F. EVENT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The Olympic trials, scheduled for January, have made Nichols' job much
easier this year. Most top-ranked U.S. women are looking for any summer-time
marathon in which to run and the San Francisco version offers excellent
conditions.;    The hills of San Francisco make this marathon challenging. The
weather, however, makes it one of the few enticing races held from June to
September. Early morning temperatures range in the low 50s in late June.;   
"This is the only place in the world where you can have a marathon in the
middle of summer," Nichols said.;    Defending champ back;  Last year's
winner, Janis Klecker of Minnetonka, Minn., is entered. The field also boasts
Janine Aiello of Albuquerque, N.M.; Michelle Bush-Cuke of Berrien Springs,
Mich.; Christine Gibbons of Elmwood, N.J.; Lesley Lahane of Chestnut Hills,
Mass.; Julie Shea-Graw of Raleigh, N.C., and Jane Welzel of Fort Collins,
Colo.;    All seven women have run marathons under the 2-hour, 40-minute
barrier. Klecker turned in a 2:39:52 on the 26.2-mile course.;    Welzel is
the 1990 national champion, Gibbons has won 26 marathons, Lahane is a former
cross-country national champion and Aiello twice has finished second in San
Francisco.;    A test for Shea-Graw; Shea-Graw, 32, finished third in the 1981
New York City Marathon and was consistently ranked among the top five American
runners throughout most of the early '80s. She was the top qualifier for the
1980 Olympics team that missed the Moscow Summer Games because of a U.S.
boycott.;    This will be Shea-Graw's first race outside of North Carolina
since 1986, when she took time off to have a child.;    "I've run some local
races," Shea-Graw said. "This is going to be a test for me. If it goes well,
then I'll up the ante and give my training the time that is needed to become
competitive again.";    Shea-Graw's best time is 2:30:11.;    "I had some
major injuries and wanted to have a child," Shea-Graw said. "But now it's time
to get on with my career."  </TEXT>
