<DESCRIPT>  US; COURT; JUDGE; CANDIDATE; SPOUSE; PROBE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Virginia Thomas is a soft-spoken, hard-working daughter of the heartland: a
brainy Omaha, Neb., lawyer who has scaled the sheer cliffs of professional
Washington; a churchgoer who invites homeless people out to lunch; a good
friend.;   Why the fuss over Mrs. Supreme Court Nominee?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Her critics see her as more than the supportive spouse who'll accompany her
husband, Clarence, through his Senate confirmation hearings, which began
Tuesday and are likely to run through next week. They see a woman with strong
opinions on issues that are bound to come before the court.;   Some
women's-rights activists are upset by her lobbying against such issues as
comparable-worth legislation. Some religious-rights groups are troubled by her
anti-cult activities in light of her former involvement with Lifespring, a
motivational group.;   Her race draws criticism; Even the color of her skin is
being used to determine the content of Clarence Thomas's character. The fact
that she is white has drawn criticism from some blacks who see the marriage as
evidence that Clarence Thomas has rejected his roots.;   In their respective
careers, the Thomases have embraced the view that women and minorities are
hindered, rather than helped, by affirmative action and government programs.
True equality is achieved by holding everyone to the same standard, they
believe.;   Virginia Thomas has represented the conservative viewpoint in her
jobs as a staffer for a Republican congressman, spokeswoman at the U.S.
Chamber of Congress and deputy assistant secretary at the Department of
Labor.;   Clarence Thomas advocates a colorblind society, and his marriage may
be an example of that philosophy. But others see a different symbolism.;  
'Sign of rejection'; "His marrying a white woman is a sign of his rejection of
the black community," said Russell Adams, chairman of Howard University's
department of Afro-American studies. "Great justices have had community roots
that served as a basis for understanding the Constitution. Clarence's lack of
a sense of community makes his nomination troubling.";   Some religious
leaders are troubled as well. Dean Kelley, the National Council of Churches'
counselor on religious liberty, wrote a critique of Clarence Thomas that was
used as grounds for his organization's opposition to the Supreme Court
nominee. The author did not mention Virginia Thomas in his text but has said
he was concerned about her involvement in the Cult Awareness Network (CAN), a
Chicago-based organization that says it educates the public about
"destructive" cults. That involvement, he said, might affect her husband's
handling of religious-liberty cases if he shares her views on the subject.;  
During the early '80s, Virginia Thomas enrolled in Lifespring, a self-help
course that challenges students to take responsibility for their lives. She
was troubled by some of the activities and eventually broke with the
organization. Since 1985, she has been a public advocate against cult
activities.;   When she served as a labor-relations attorney at the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce from 1985 to 1989, she represented the interests of the
business community at congressional hearings on such issues as comparable
worth, affirmative action and federal child-care legislation.  </TEXT>
