<LEADPARA>  Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas told the Senate Judiciary Committee
today it is "irrelevant" whether he holds any personal opinion on abortion,
spurring new frustration among the committee's Democrats.;   But as the
hearings' third day got under way, no groundswell of opposition to his
confirmation seemed to be emerging.  </LEADPARA>

COURT NOMINEE SAYS HIS PERSONAL OPINION OF

<TEXT>     Asked several times by Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., about women's right to end
their pregnancies, Thomas said, "Whether or not I have a view is irrelevant.";
  President Bush, asked at a news conference whether Thomas' claim not to have
an opinion on abortion is credible, answered, "That's a question for the
Senate to decide.";   "He's handling himself very well," the president said.
"I think he's doing a beautiful job up there. I feel more confident than ever
that he will be confirmed.";   Thomas' answers have frustrated the committee's
Democrats, who say he is an evasive witness. They also have voiced skepticism
about his backing away from stands he took in past writings and speeches.;  
Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., began to show signs of exasperation
today during spirited questioning about the nominee's views on "natural law,"
a theory that certain rights exist independent of written law.;   At one
point, Biden accused Thomas of using "tortuous logic." Later, he referred to
one of Thomas' replies as "the most unartful dodge I've heard." After still
another Thomas answer, Biden said, "That's not the question I asked you,
judge.";   Republicans tried to deflect criticism over Thomas' refusal to
answer questions from the Democrats.;   "It is, in my view, inappropriate to
keep this up," said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. He said Thomas had been asked
more than 70 questions about his abortion views even though Justice David H.
Souter was asked only 36 such questions during his confirmation hearings last
year.;   "What are we going to have? Sixty-four-thousand questions on abortion
before we're done with this approach?" Hatch asked. "Enough is enough.";  
Thomas said Senate confirmation of his nomination would give him "an
opportunity to serve and give back" and to "bring something different to the
court.";   "I can walk in the shoes of the people who are affected by what the
court does," Thomas said.;   Several senators were openly skeptical Wednesday
over Thomas' insistence that he has no opinion on the 1973 Supreme Court
decision legalizing abortion.;   If that's so, said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.,
"he's the only person gathered in the room who does not have an opinion.";  
Kohl added, "I'm concerned about his candor, his willingness to be
forthcoming.";   Today, Kohl asked the nominee, "Is it fair of you to say to
us, for the most part, just view me on what I'm saying here this week?";  
Kohl asked the black federal judge whether he was offended by published
comments calling his appointment by President Bush a "quota.";   "That would
trouble anyone," Thomas said, adding, "I don't think it's accurate." He said
Bush assured him he was picked because he was the best qualified of those
potential nominees considered.;   Thomas is expected to continue testifying
through Friday. The committee next week will hear from other witnesses.;   Two
pivotal members of the 14-member committee -- Howell Heflin, D-Ala., and Arlen
Specter, R-Pa. -- also voiced concern about Thomas' answers. But the panel's
traditional third swing vote, Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said Thomas was doing
well.;   Thomas' opponents believe Republicans Strom Thurmond of South
Carolina, Hatch, Charles Grassley of Iowa, Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Hank
Brown of Colorado are solid Thomas backers.;   But they hope Sens. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., and Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, will be joined by the three
swing-vote senators and Biden, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Simon and Kohl in
voting against the nominee.; THOMAS' VIEWS; Excerpts from Clarence Thomas'
testimony:; On abortion: "I have no reason or agenda to prejudge the issue . .
. or a predilection to rule one way or another on the issue of abortion."; On
affirmative action: "The line that I drew was a line that said that we
shouldn't have preferences, or goals, or timetables or quotas."; On natural
law: "At no time did I feel, nor do I feel now, that natural law is anything
more than the background to our Constitution."; HEAR IT, SEE IT; Senate
confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas are scheduled
to run through Friday this week and every weekday except Wednesday next week.;
