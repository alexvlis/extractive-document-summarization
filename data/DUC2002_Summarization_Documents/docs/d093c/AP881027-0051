   More than 100 people were feared drowned
after an overcrowded ferry sank at a river junction in southern
Bangladesh, police said today.
   Fifteen bodies were recovered and 94 people were reported missing
in the sinking Wednesday night where the Ilisha and Tetulia rivers
meet and join the Meghna, police and a district administrator said.
   Another ferry was attacked by river pirates near Chandpur late
Tuesday, police said. Six passengers, including a pregnant woman,
were thrown overboard and have not been found, Chandpur police said.
   About 200 passengers were wounded when the pirates fired rifles
and hurled homemade bombs before making off with about $83,000 in
local currency, police said.
   The ferry that sank was carrying more than double its authorized
capacity of 100 passengers, police said. They said about 100 people
on the ferry's roof swam to safety but most of those in the hull
were unable to save themselves.
   The ferry was traveling from Mehendiganj to the island town of
Bhola, about 68 miles southeast of Dhaka, when it sank in 22 feet of
water.
   Police said six bodies were found in the hull of the ferry, the
M.L. Sonali, and nine others were found more than a mile downstream.
   Two independent newspapers in Dhaka, Ittefaq and Sangbad, quoted
survivors as saying the ferry went out of control while trying to
negotiate a turn.
   The pirate attack on the second ferry, the M.V. Sagar, also
occurred on the Meghna River. The Sagar was en route from Dhaka to
Barisal when about 50 pirates launched their attack near Chandpur,
34 miles southeast of Dhaka.
   The pirates, who had boarded the ferry as passengers, opened fire
and exploded bombs shortly before midnight Tuesday as people were
bedding down for the night, Chandpur police said.
   The attackers escaped in waiting boats, the police added. They
said 44 of the injured passengers were hospitalized, including four
in critical condition.
