   TOKYO (AP _ Emperor Hirohito will be remembered for one
overwhelming decision during his 62-year reign: Japan must bow to
defeat for the first time in its history and end the Pacific
conflict in World War II.
   Shortly after that decision, and for most of his reign, Hirohito
became a figurehead, isolated from his subjects by tradition and
steeped in his great love, the study of marine biology. He was the
last survivor among the national leaders of the World War II era.
   But in his first 20 years, the ``Son of Heaven'' was worshiped as
a divinity descended from the Sun Goddess Amaterasu.
   The solitude of animal and plant life under the seas which so
intrigued Hirohito was in keeping with the character of the man who
became the 124th occupant of the Chrysanthemum Throne at the age of
25 on Christmas Day 1926, designating his reign ``Showa'' _
``enlightened peace.''
   The emperor was generally portrayed as having played no
significant role in planning or carrying out Japan's military
adventures in the 1930s and 1940s. But it was his first effective
decision as emperor, and his most courageous, that ended the Pacific
conflict.
   On Aug. 10, 1945, four days after history's first atomic bomb
devastated Hiroshima and one day after a U.S. bomber dropped the
second atomic bomb on Nagasaki, the generals and admirals of
Imperial Japan's wartime government argued for hours in the
sweltering bombproof shelter beneath the Tokyo palace.
   Should Japan agree to the Allies' surrender demand, or fight on
until annihilation?
   Speaking in what some of those present described as a slow and
obviously nervous monotone, Hirohito, the spiritual and titular
leader, offered his opinion for the first time. He spoke of his
sorrow over the soldiers and sailors killed in the long war, and of
families who lost everything in air raids.
   ``I cannot bear to see my innocent people suffer any longer,'' he
said. ``Ending the war is the only way to restore world peace and to
relieve the nation from the terrible distress with which it is
burdened.''
   Then, evoking a memory of his grandfather, the Emperor Meiji,
whose reign (1867-1912) saw the end of 250 years of feudal Japanese
isolation from the outside world, Hirohito told the officers:
   ``The time has come when we must bear the unbearable.''
   In the days that followed, Hirohito continued his break with
tradition. In a national radio broadcast Aug. 15 _ the first time
ordinary Japanese ever actually heard his voice _ he personally
announced the decision to surrender.
   He told the ravaged nation that ``the war situation has developed
not necessarily to our advantage.''
   Three weeks later, Hirohito donned a silk cutaway coat, striped
trousers and a top hat to meet the Allied commander, Gen. Douglas A.
MacArthur, at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. It was the first time
Hirohito had ever gone to see anyone, and the first of several calls
on the general who had led the Pacific war against Japan and became
its postwar governor.
   On New Year's Day 1946, at MacArthur's insistence, the emperor
publicly renounced his divinity. It was a choice that enabled
Hirohito to remain as the symbolic head of his nation and assured
that he would not face charges as a war criminal, as some abroad had
demanded.
   It also was an act that seemed to relieve no one as much as this
gentle, shy and retiring man who never seemed very comfortable as a
``living god.''
   The emperor's status in the eyes of many Japanese changed to that
of a kind uncle.
   He became a widely respected authority on marine biology. He
possessed rare collections of marine life, discovered several
species himself and wrote or co-authored at least 12 books on
hydrozoa, or sea animals, his specialty.
   In recent years, his life had become the subject of a popular
comic book series.
   Still, Hirohito and the imperial system remained important to
Japan.
   A nationwide survey by the daily newspaper Mainichi Shimbun in
March 1987 indicated more than 80 percent of 2,184 people polled
supported the imperial system, while only 11 percent said it should
be abolished. Five percent said the emperor should have more power.
   From 1946 to 1954, Hirohito toured Japan to encourage the people
to rebuild.
   The Imperial Household Agency, which ran his affairs, said
Hirohito considered the postwar period one of the most fulfilling
times of his life, in which the nation made a phenomenal recovery
from a war that cost 3.1 million Japanese lives.
   Despite the humanization of the Imperial family, Hirohito
remained under strict control of the Imperial Household Agency.
Protocol was maintained at nearly all times and he was prohibited
from speaking on any controversial subject.
   Hirohito was born on April 29, 1901. In accordance with age-old
imperial custom, he was taken from his parents as an infant to be
reared in isolation by household functionaries and trained for one
role, that of emperor.
   His education came as Japan surged into the modern world. The
feudal samurai ethic was still strong; when his grandfather died,
Gen. Maresuke Nogi, the mentor for the 11-year-old prince, calmly
committed ritual suicide to follow the emperor, his master, to the
grave.
   Hirohito studied government and law with private tutors. When he
was 20, his father, Emperor Taisho, sent him abroad _ the first time
any member of the immediate imperial family was allowed outside
Japan.
   Hirohito visited England, Scotland, France, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Italy, receiving various decorations. He was also
received by Pope Benedict XV.
   The young man handled money for the first time, paying his own
fare on the Paris subway. He developed a passion for bacon and eggs
and it became a lifelong breakfast habit. A palace chamberlain said
in a 1980 interview that Hirohito shunned Japanese food ``unless it
is forced on him by an unwitting host.''
   Hirohito also acquired a preference for Western clothes. He was
never seen in public wearing traditional Japanese garb, and a palace
official confided that the Emperor of Japan did not even own a
kimono.
   Hirohito became prince regent on Nov. 25, 1921, after his father
became a mental and physical invalid, became emperor five years
later and was formally enthroned in 1928.
