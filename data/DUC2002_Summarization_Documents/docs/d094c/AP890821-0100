   Emperor Hirohito left $13.06 million in taxable
property, a tax office near the Imperial Palace announced Monday.
   It was the first time that tax authorities have disclosed the
amount of an emperor's taxable estate, an official in the Kojimachi
Tax Office said. Until the end of World War II, emperors were
regarded as living gods.
   Hirohito died of cancer on Jan. 7 at age 87. He was succeeded by
Akihito, his eldest son. Hirohito's wife, Nagako, became empress
dowager.
   Akihito has paid $2.99 million in inheritance taxes on his half
of his father's estate, which he divided evenly with his mother. The
empress dowager, as Hirohito's spouse, was exempt from paying
inheritance taxes, Kyodo News Service reported.
   The Japanese constitution, drafted by U.S. occupation forces
shortly after the end of World War II in 1945, stipulates the
emperor is the ``symbol of the state and the unity of the people.''
   Hirohito's estate included stocks and other personal belongings.
Three sacred treasures _ a mirror, sword and jewels _ which were
transferred from emperor to emperor, were tax-exempt, as were about
3,180 items of art owned by Hirohito that were donated to the state,
the tax office official said.
