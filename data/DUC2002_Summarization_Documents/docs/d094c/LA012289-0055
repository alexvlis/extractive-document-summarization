DEATH OF HIROHITO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The death of Emperor Hirohito finished the list of political and military 
leaders of the World War II era, one of the darkest and bloodiest eras of 
history on either the European or Asian continents. 
</P>
<P>
The political and military role that Emperor Hirohito played before and during 
the war was never clear to us. He may not have had that kind of influence now, 
but before the war he was regarded as god and was worshiped in Japan with 
religious vigor. At the surrender of the Imperial Japanese government, Hirohito 
was spared punishment because "it was his ambitious military generals who made 
the decision to invade the neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
I found it is very hard to believe that a man in his middle age, in his 
position, in his culture and in his country at that time had nothing much to do 
with all the military aggravations that his armies imposed on neighboring 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, some Japanese military leaders were executed after the war for 
criminal acts they were responsible for. I often wonder if Hirohito ever felt 
grateful to those generals who were sacrificed, in part, so that he could live 
for another 43 years. I only wish that the soul of Emperor Hirohito be ready to 
face the ultimate justice when he meets with the waiting souls of millions of 
innocent men, women and children who were tortured and murdered in his name 
during the war.
