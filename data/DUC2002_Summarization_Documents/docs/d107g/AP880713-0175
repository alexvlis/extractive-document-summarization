   Here is a state-by-state summary of drought developments
Wednesday:

<HEAD>ALABAMA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Alabama National Guard is still hauling up to 25,000 gallons
of water a day to 10 communities across the state despite recent
rains.
   At the height of the drought last month, the Guard was hauling
water to 12 locations. The Guard's water-hauling program has been
in continuous operation since last July in west-central Alabama
because of a low water table.

   In an effort to help Georgia farmers locate hay, the state
Department of Agriculture announced it will start compiling a list
of sources.
   Commissioner Tommy Irvin urged those with a surplus for sale to
contact the department. He said information will be compiled and
updated regularly.

   State Treasurer Jerry Cosentino announced a program to provide
drought-stricken farmers with access to commercial loans with
below-market interest rates. The treasurer's office will commit $50
million to banks at a lower-than-normal interest yield and in turn
those banks will offer farmers loans with rates as low as 10
percent.
   ``I know what the farmers first need is rain but that is out of
our hands right now,'' Cosentino said. ``The next best thing they
can get ... would be additional funds to carry them over until next
year.''

   A group of Indiana farmers sued a New Jersey insurance company,
saying the company acted in bad faith when it reneged on $2.5
million in drought insurance. The lawsuit seeks an
``undeterminable'' amount of damages from Pio-Gard Agency of Ohio
Inc. and Federal Insurance Co., a subsidiary of the Chubb Group
Insurance Cos. of Warren, N.J.

<HEAD>IOWA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Forecasters say Iowa's weather is returning to the hot, dry
drought pattern which settled over the state for much of June.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>KENTUCKY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The first emergency shipment of Oregon hay to help
drought-stricken Kentucky farmers arrived, but logistical problems
forced agriculture officials to delay its distribution until next
week.
   ``It's a nightmare trying to find a fair way to do this,'' said
Roger Nesbitt, a spokesman for the Kentucky Department of
Agriculture.
   Nesbitt said Wednesday's 20-ton shipment, flown free from
Portland, Ore., by United Parcel Service, will be sold to farmers
on Monday.

<HEAD>MINNESOTA</HEAD>

   Heavy rain fell on some of the driest areas of central and
east-central Minnesota, but it was ``way, way below what we should
have, as far as precipitation goes,'' a National Weather Service
hydrologist said.
   ``We need ... a widespread distribution over a long period of
time, say maybe 10 inches of rainfall to get us back to what we
normally should be,'' Gary McDevitt said.
   It was the heaviest rainfall for the east-central part of the
state since April 26, when the area got about a half-inch of rain.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MISSISSIPPI</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Weather experts say Mississippi could see above normal rainfall
in the coming week. Rainfall during the week ending Wednesday
averaged 1 inch in some areas, with some extreme northern counties
receiving greater amounts.
   But the weather service said all Mississippi farm communities
still had only 30 percent to 50 percent of normal moisture.

<HEAD>MISSOURI</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Road builders in the Kansas City area say the effects of dry
weather in the Midwest this year are not all bad. Engineers say
several highway projects in the area will be open to traffic at
least a month earlier than expected because of fewer interruptions
caused by rain and wet weather.

   As many as 20 fires, sparked by lightning from thunderstorms,
have blackened about 1,500 acres in the Custer National Forest. The
fires are being fought by from 150 to 200 firefighters. A
lightning-caused fire in the Bob Marshall Wilderness Area of
northwest Montana was being allowed to burn naturally, officials
said.

<HEAD>NEBRASKA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   State Agriculture Director Roy Frederick said Nebraska farmers
probably will have better crops than are expected nationwide and
may benefit from higher prices.
   Nebraska's outlook for the corn crop is rosier than national
predictions because 75 percent of the corn comes from irrigated
acres and Nebraska has received more rain than some other states,
he said.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NORTH DAKOTA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Gov. George Sinner has asked federal officials to declare all 53
North Dakota counties disaster areas because of the drought. Sinner
says the drought has wiped out small grain crops and is beginning
to take a toll on row crops.
   The State Agricultural Statistics Service said North Dakota
farmers will abandon 31 percent of their spring wheat this year and
harvest the smallest crop in 19 years because of the drought. That
compares to a normal abandonment of about 5 percent. Abandonment
has not been so high in the state since the 1930s.

<HEAD>OHIO</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Lt. Gov. Paul Leonard, who heads a state drought task force,
said he would not advocate statewide mandatory water restrictions
but said local governments should have the authority to impose
restrictions where necessary.
   In central Ohio, farmers awaited what will be the largest
haylift of the season _ 50 truckloads of hay from the South
scheduled to arrive Thursday night in Columbus.

   Thunderstorms hit Brown County with heavy rain and hail that
damaged drought-stricken crops. Rain was heavy north and east of
Aberdeen and spotty elsewhere.
   Stanley and Thelma Dennert, who live three miles west of
Houghton, reported 3.75 inches of rain within an hour. ``It was
hard with a little bit of hail. It really came down in sheets,''
said Mrs. Dennert.
   Authorities said no tornado sightings were confirmed, but about
a dozen funnel clouds were reported.

<HEAD>TENNESSEE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The drought-plagued Mississippi River measured seventh-tenths of
a foot higher than expected at Memphis because of rainfall
throughout West Tennessee. The Mississippi was still 21 feet lower
than normal for this time of year, however, and the Coast Guard
said the slight rise had no effect on commercial traffic on the
river.

   The drought has dried up summer jobs at the Stokley USA cannery
in Merrill.
   During most summers, the plant provides three months' employment
for about 300 workers on three shifts, but this year there are only
225 seasonal employees on two shifts, said Vern Warren, plant
manager.
   ``It's been on and off so far. The drought conditions have made
it a little difficult for us,'' Warren said.
