<HEAD>Report: High-Ranking German Demands Soviets Hand Over Honecker</HEAD>

   A ranking member of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's party demanded the Soviet Union hand over Erich Honecker,
who is wanted by German authorities on manslaughter charges, a
newspaper reported on Saturday.
   Federal lawmaker Johannes Gerster said refusal to turn over the
deposed East German leader for trial could ``burden'' Bonn and
Moscow's ``outstanding relations,'' the Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung
newspaper reported.
   A Berlin court has issued an arrest warrant for Honecker, 78, on
the manslaughter charges. He is accused of issuing shoot-to-kill
orders to East German guards at the now-fallen Berlin Wall.
   Honecker has denied all charges against him, including that he
was personally responsible for the estimated 200 people who died
trying to escape his repressive government.
   He has taken refuge at a Soviet military hospital in Beelitz,
outside Berlin.
   Soviet officials have said Honecker is staying at the hospital
for humanitarian reasons, and German police need permission from
the Soviets to gain entry.
   ``I demand that the Soviet government immediately release Erich
Honecker and extradite him to German justice officials,'' the
Osnabrueck newspaper quoted Gerster, a member of Kohl's Christian
Democrats, as saying.
   Honecker's fate is one of the first issues facing Bonn and
Moscow since they signed several treaties designed to draw the two
nations closer together.
