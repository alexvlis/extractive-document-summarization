   As protests gathered strength last fall, East
Germany's longtime orthodox leader Erich Honecker ``lost touch with
reality,'' according to the man who succeeded him as Communist
leader only to be ousted later.
   Egon Krenz, the successor, and former Politburo member Guenter
Schabowski on Wednesday gave their versions of the bunker mentality
that engulfed the hard-liners toward the end.
   ``There was the notion in the former party leadership that
everything outside of planned events and demonstrations staged by
the Communist youth group was an action organized by enemy
forces,'' Krenz told an investigating commission in East Berlin.
   The testimony was broadcast on East German television.
   Schabowski said Honecker had personally ordered police attacks
against demonstrators in early October, working closely with his
then-secret police chief, Erich Mielke.
   ``Honecker took things into his own hands,'' Schabowski said.
``All decisions and orders that led to the police actions against
demonstrators and to their arrrest went exclusively through
Honecker and Mielke.''
   Like Krenz, Schabowski denied any personal responsibility for
the orders to attack the demonstrators in the capital.
   The attempts at suppression were engineered by Honecker and
Mielke, bypassing the other 19 members of the ruling Politburo,
Krenz insisted.
   ``Then-general secretary Erich Honecker and the internal
security chief Erich Mielke immediately after each session of the
Politburo consulted with each other on the security situation of
the German Democratic Republic,'' Krenz said.
   Honecker and Mielke are now targeted for an indictment for high
treason.
   The East Berlin city government commission is probing possible
criminal charges stemming from police brutality during the October
attacks in the capital.
   Club-swinging riot police brutally beat demonstrators on Oct. 7
and 8, when Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was in town to
commemorate the country's 40th anniversary. The uprising was a
turning point that speeded Honecker's downfall 10 days later.
   Krenz, who had responsibility for many internal security
functions before Honecker's ouster, criticized the use of force
during his testimony Wednesday.
   ``The excessive action of law enforcement authorities was
neither politically nor morally justifiable,'' he told the panel,
speaking confidently and wearing a gray suit.
   Krenz, who was thrown out six weeks after succeeding Honecker on
Oct. 18, insisted he knew nothing about any orders to shoot
demonstrators. Numerous news media accounts have said Honecker
either planned or issued such orders.
   Krenz said he accepted ``joint responsibility for misjudging
dissident citizens and dissident groups for years.''
   ``From today's viewpoint it is incomprehensible that there was
no general Politburo discussion about the negative developments
then taking place in society,'' said Krenz, an influential
Politburo member even before Honecker's fall.
   Krenz added that he and other then-members of the Politburo
failed to realize that the Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches
were ``not working against but rather for the German Democratic
Republic.''
   ``Honecker had lost touch with reality and had unrealistic
perspectives,'' Krenz said of his one-time patron, who for years
treated him like a son.
   Honecker has been in ill health following gallbladder surgery
last summer. He was recently operated on for a malignant kidney
tumor.
   Krenz's current occupation has not been publicized, following
his fall as party chief on Dec. 3.
