<HEAD>Report: Ousted Stasi Chief Threatened Honecker in Jail</HEAD>

   East Germany's ousted secret police
chief threatened to break former Communist leader Erich Honecker's
neck when the two faced each other in jail, a West German newspaper
reported Wednesday.
   ``You traitor!'' 82-year-old former security chief Erich Mielke
shouted at Honecker, according to Bild newspaper.
   Mielke also screamed at Honecker ``I'll break your neck!'' the
newspaper quoted witnesses as describing the scene when the two met
in an East German jail. Honecker, 78, was jailed for one day in
January.
   Mielke for years headed the dreaded secret police, known as
Stasi, which built up files on 6 million East Germans and kept a
tight rein on the population. He was one of Honecker's closest
aides.
   After the popular revolt last fall that ousted the Communist
regime and opened the way to German unification, Mielke and other
former Communist leaders were jailed.
   Mielke remains in custody. Honecker was released from jail for
health reasons.
   West German authorities on Tuesday opened a criminal
investigation of Mielke. He is suspected of giving sanctuary to
members of West Germany's leftist terrorist group, the Red Army
Faction, and of setting up contacts between the group and
Palestinian guerrillas.
   Honecker is also the target of several criminal investigations,
one in West Germany for obstruction of justice.
   Bild said the imprisoned Mielke also accused other former
Communist officials of betrayal and threatened to retaliate against
them.
   One prison warden told Bild that many of the guards had worked
for Mielke's Stasi and that they might interpret his threat against
Honecker as an order to kill the former Communist chief.
   Bild said Mielke and other members of Honecker's ruling circle
will be moved to a West Berlin prison after German unification on
Oct. 3.
   Honecker also will be moved to the same jail if his health
improves enough for him to be imprisoned. He is suffering from
kidney cancer and is being kept at a Soviet military hospital
oustide East Berlin.
