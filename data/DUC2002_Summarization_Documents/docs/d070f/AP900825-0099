<HEAD>Report: Honecker Unlikely To Go to Trial in East Germany</HEAD>

   Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker will
not stand trial in East Germany as long as the formerly Communist
country exists, a West German newspaper reported.
   The Hamburg-based Bild am Sonntag said Saturday that it would
report in its Sunday editions that Honecker could be prosecuted in
a united Germany, however, for violation of property laws.
   Bild quoted Guenter Seidel, an East German prosecutor, as saying
that Honecker had used $42 million for stocking a private housing
estate for leaders of the former Communist government.
   However, Seidel said that the investigation was not far enough
along to determine whether charges could be filed against Honecker
before East Germany merges with West Germany on Oct. 3.
   Negotiators are still working out the merger of the two German
legal systems.
   Honecker, 78, was ousted as East Germany's leader on Oct. 18,
paving the way for the country's first freely elected government in
March. Honecker is in poor health and remains confined to a Soviet
military hospital in Beelitz outside East Berlin.
   He is under investigation on allegations of abuse of power,
corruption, harboring terrorists and issuing shoot-to-kill orders
to prevent East Germans from escaping to West Germany when he
served as the country's leader.
   Bild said that Erich Mielke, the ex-head of East Germany's
former secret police, was also unlikely to go to court in East
Germany.
   ``I am at the end. I am a dead man,'' Bild quoted Mielke, 82, as
saying at his last interrogation.
