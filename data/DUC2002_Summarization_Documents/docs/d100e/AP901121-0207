   Drummer Andy Newmark was touring with Roxy Music
in the summer of 1980 when he got the call that changed his life:
He was to play on John Lennon's new album.
   Lennon had been in virtual seclusion for five years, busy taking
care of his son, Sean, and admittedly out of songwriting ideas. But
in 1980, he suddenly felt inspired again and planned to return to
the studio to make an album with his wife, Yoko Ono.
   It was more than a superstar session. Afterall, Lennon gave no
press conferences, and didn't attend clubs or concerts. Rare photos
occasionally emerged and he looked different in each one (Lennon
jokingly referred to himself as ``Greta Hughes'' and ``Howard
Garbo'').
   Producer Jack Douglas, who had worked with Lennon as an
engineer, recruited Newmark, bassist Tony Levin, guitarist Hugh
McCracken and other New York-based sessions players. Recording was
to take place at the Hit Factory in Manhattan.
   To Newmark, Lennon was a hero and only a hero. He didn't know
him and was nervous about working with him. The drummer guessed he
was something like the intense, irreverent young man of the movies
``Help!'' and ``A Hard Day's Night.'' Lennon was those things - and
more.
   ``His personality seemed so consistent with all we had ever
heard about John Lennon,'' said Newmark, who still lives in New
York and works with former Roxy Music singer Bryan Ferry.
   ``His straightforwardness was as visible and apparant as the
stories and images we had created. I didn't see anything that
seemed startlingly new to the myth. It just appeared to be what we
had imagined: down to earth, direct, so direct it could not offend
people.''
   Newmark spent just one month in the studio, playing on the songs
that eventually ended up on ``Double Fantasy'' and ``Milk and
Honey,'' Lennon's final albums. It was the ``best experience of my
life,'' he insisted. ``The highlight of my career.''
   The nerves quickly settled. Once recording began, Lennon was
just a ``working musician'' with the same goal as everyone else:
finishing the album. The music was mostly mainstream pop; no
18-minute jams or political anthems. ``I hate all that fancy
stuff,'' Lennon told his drummer. ``Keep it simple, like Ringo.''
   He was a happy man at this point and his singing was higher,
sweeter than on earlier albums. Lennon was hoping to get back in
touch with his audience, and the songs were melodic, the production
lush.
   ``Dear Yoko'' and ``Grow Old With Me'' were tributes to his
wife. ``Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)'' was for Sean. Lennon defended
his self-imposed retirement on ``Watching the Wheels'' and summed
up his feelings about turning 40 on ``Borrowed Time,'' capping the
line ``Good to be older'' with a self-assured ``you bet.''
   Between takes, Lennon jammed on Buddy Holly songs and played
host. Sushi was the food of choice. The strongest drug was
Brazilian coffee, freshly ground. ``Guys, I'm taking off,'' Lennon
would say as he poured himself another cup.
   And there were plenty of stories about the Beatles - the
``B's,'' as John called them. Reunions were out of the question, a
return to adolescence in his opinion, but talking about the old
days seemed the nicest kind of high.
   ``By this time he was old enough to look upon the work they did
and be proud of it,'' Newmark said. ``When he talked about the
`B's,' it was as if it was his band. He was the spiritual leader. I
felt that a lot through the sessions.''
   By the fall, Newmark had finished working on the album, and his
contact with Lennon was limited to an occasional visit to the
studio. But he had planned on working with him again. ``Milk and
Honey'' was to come out the following year and Lennon wanted to
tour, using many of the same musicians.
   ``Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans,''
Lennon once sang.
   It took the drummer a long time to recover from Lennon's murder
the night of Dec. 8, 1980; he didn't even feel like working for the
next few years - everything else suddenly seemed ``second rate.''
   Newmark never listens to the record, but still hears ``Woman''
on the radio. When he thinks about it now, it's not so much a
particular song that hurts him, it's the day-to-day stuff: the
jokes and wisecracks, the coffee and the stories. No one had a
reason to remember all that at the time; those weren't supposed to
be farewell sessions.
   ``When I looked in his eyes, I felt a tremendous depth of
character and a tremendous understanding of the human condition, a
tremendous amount of compassion,,'' Newmark said. ``He was totally
friendly and open to everybody, including the janitor. He had time
for everybody. That working class hero thing, he was trying to be
real about that.''
