   John Lennon's worldwide message of peace was
delivered Tuesday as his song ``Imagine'' was played simultaneously
for 1 billion people in 130 countries to celebrate what would have
been his 50th birthday.
   ``A dream we dream alone is only a dream, but the dream we dream
together is reality. Happy birthday, John. The world is better
today for sharing a time with you,'' Yoko Ono said at a United
Nations ceremony before the playing of ``Imagine.''
   The slain former Beatle himself issued a call for harmony in a
taped message that served as an introduction to the music.
   ``We all want peace, whatever sort of job we have. ... Think of
your children. Do you want them to be killed or don't you? And
that's the choice we have in front of us. War or peace,'' said
Lennon, whose son Sean turned 15 Tuesday.
   None of the other Beatles were at the United Nations, but a
tribute came from Lennon's old songwriting partner, Paul McCartney,
who released a live version of the Beatles' tune ``Birthday.'' The
song, originally on the ``White Album,'' was the first
Lennon-McCartney single released since the Beatles broke up in
1969.
   ``The release date and John's birthday is just a happy
coincidence, but it's also a nod and a wink to my old mate,'' said
McCartney, 47.
   Other observances were held from Liverpool to Moscow to Los
Angeles.
   In Lennon's hometown in England, fans gathered at the former
site of the Cavern Club, where the Beatles were discovered.
   Among those attending was Lennon's 71-year-old uncle, Charlie
Lennon.
   When asked how his nephew would have reacted to the ceremonies,
he said: ``If he had been alive I doubt he would have come and even
if he had, he would sat with me in the pub and had a good laugh.''
   On the West Coast, about 50 people - part of an estimated 1
billion people worldwide who had access to the event - stood near
Lennon's star on the Walk of Fame and listened to the ``Imagine''
broadcast:
   ``Imagine all the people, living life in peace
   ``You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one
   ``I hope some day you'll join us
   ``And the world will live as one.''
   ``His spirit still lives in all of us whose lives have been
touched with him,'' Ono said of her late husband.
   ``I would like us to remember and celebrate his birthday as a
day of love, because he was a man of love, and because love is much
needed at this time in our lives.''
   Ono was greeted by Marcela Perez de Cuellar, wife of the U.N.
secretary-general. During her brief remarks, Ono also quoted a line
from another of Lennon's songs, ``Happy Xmas (War is Over)'':
``Remember, war is over if you want it.''
   More than 1,000 radio stations and networks from 50 countries
broadcast the 10-minute event. U.S. Armed Forces television and
radio beamed it to 80-plus other countries. MTV televised the
``Imagine'' video in 25 countries, said Andrea Smith, a spokeswoman
for the network.
   In Moscow, about 1,000 Soviets gathered at the Moscow Electrical
Lamp Factory's cultural hall to listen to Lennon's music, snap up
his albums and posters and reflect on his life.
   Even the staid state television program ``Vremya'' got into the
act. An anchorman, reporting on the worldwide birthday bash,
described ``Imagine'' as an ``anthem of peace.'' The broadcast
ended with an instrumental version of ``Yesterday.''
   Not so long ago, the Beatles' music was banned in the Soviet
Union. In 1964, one commentator warned that ``these bugs can
swiftly ignite the very darkest and primitive passions.''
   Lennon was shot to death by a deranged fan outside his Manhattan
apartment building on Dec. 8, 1980.
