   The image of a dour, shoeless English boy
and his absent, carefree mother prompted Julia Baird and Geoffrey
Giuliano to collaborate on a book.
   The boy is the public image of young John Lennon, Baird's
half-brother and Giuliano's idol. But the neglected urchin and his
live-it-up mother _ who was also Baird's mother _ never existed, the
authors say.
   ``That woman laughing, singing, dancing, saying goodbye to John,
and John standing there alone crying `Mummy, Mummy!' That's not my
brother, that's not my mother, that's not my children's
grandmother,'' said Baird, who recently spent three weeks in the
United States promoting her book, a family portrait of Lennon and
his Liverpool roots.
   Published in North America last fall, ``John Lennon, My Brother''
was co-authored by Giuliano, a Beatles aficionado who lives in this
Erie Canal city about 25 miles north of Buffalo.
   The two-year, cross-Atlantic collaboration came from two
different motives. Giuliano wanted to do a book about Lennon. Baird
wanted to do a book about the ex-Beatle's maligned mother, whose
name also was Julia.
   The result is a little of both, a mishmash of anecdotes showing a
moody but generally happy Liverpool boy singing with his mother in a
bathroom with good acoustics.
   Baird disagrees with other biographies which say that after his
father decamped and Julia turned her son over to her sister, Mimi,
Lennon was a grim youth who felt abandoned by his mother.
   ``I didn't do it for John,'' said Baird. ``I wanted to set the
record straight about our mother, and that ties in with John. I feel
my mother has been badly misrepresented in the press.''
   Baird, a 41-year-old teacher in Cheshire, England, was born seven
years after Lennon to Julia and her common-law second husband, John
Dykins. She and her younger sister, Jacqui, grew up with their
parents amid an extended family of aunts, uncles, cousins _ and big
brother John.
   The book tells of the sisters getting hauled out of the bathtub
when teen-agers Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison drop by
for bathroom jam sessions with Julia. It tells of an alternately
thoughtless and protective brother who leaves his step-sisters at
the movies for hours while he goes on a date, who between songs at a
Beatles concert shouts for security guards to lift the Dykins girls
out of the front row, away from screaming fans threatening to storm
the stage.
   But mostly it tells of a mother and son who, while living apart,
had a loving relationship.
   The book got its start after Baird watched a British television
special in 1985 marking the fifth anniversary of Lennon's murder.
The show presented Julia ``as an unfit mother, no mother at all,''
Baird said.
   Baird complained and was urged to tell her story. She wrote an
essay and arranged to publish it in Liverpool. Then she met
Giuliano, who was in Liverpool to promote his first book, ``The
Beatles: A Celebration.''
   Giuliano, 35, a self-proclaimed huckster, convinced Baird to work
with him on a book, which he pieced together from interviews with
Baird in England. While proofreading the text, Baird sent a copy to
McCartney. He sent his blessing, plus a bonus: a brief foreword for
the book.
   With a collection of rare early photos, the book is more a family
album than a biography. Giuliano's text reads like oral history, as
if a British schoolteacher had spread the family scrapbook across
the reader's knees to boast about her brother, the musician.
   However, the book is a narrow view of Lennon, a child's
recollections of an aspiring brother. After Julia was killed in a
traffic accident in 1958, Baird saw less and less of Lennon, losing
contact with him for years when he and wife Yoko Ono moved to the
United States. The end of the book describes what Baird calls
Lennon's desire to regain his lost Liverpool roots, when she and her
step-brother exchanged letters and phone calls during 1975-80.
   Baird has been accused of cashing in on her step-brother but
insists she just wants to tell the family's story of Lennon's early
years.
   ``I could have cashed in when John was alive,'' Baird said.
``When John died the tabloids in England were knocking on the door
saying, `Write your story, name your price.' We quickly showed them
the door.''
   Also shown the door was Albert Goldman, whose sordid biography,
``The Lives of John Lennon,'' hit bookstores about the same time as
Baird's book. Baird, who read Goldman's scathing biography of Elvis
Presley, said she turned down an interview with Goldman, who brands
Lennon homosexual, anorexic and possibly a murderer.
   ``I had heard Goldman was doing the book six years ago, and I
knew what the tone would be,'' Baird said. ``Most people, including
Goldman, write books based on other books that have it all wrong.''
   Giuliano was harsher.
   ``Goldman was in it for the money from day one,'' Giuliano said.
``Goldman knows the formula: the more sleaze, the more dough. So
what's his motive? If he writes the sleaziest book he makes the most
dough.''
   Baird herself wasn't blind to the business end of publishing. She
agreed to change the title from ``My Brother John'' to ``John
Lennon, My Brother.''
   The cover's look-alike photos of Baird and Lennon in granny specs
also help, but she said she didn't don them to sell books. They're
on the National Health, Britain's medical plan, and she and Lennon
inherited their mother's short-sightedness, Baird said.
   The book itself is a loving look through rose-colored specs of a
brother whose art touched millions.
   ``It's not a major biography,'' Giuliano said. ``This book is a
little slice out of a big pie, out of a big life. It offers a lot of
previously unknown details on Lennon's early life. It's a
sympathetic view, sure, but what's not to love?''
