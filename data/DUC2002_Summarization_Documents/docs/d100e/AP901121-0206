   At this point, Lennon says he became a househusband to their
child while Yoko ran the family business. The arrangement continued
until Lennon told the woman he called ``Mother'' it was time to
make music again. ``Double Fantasy'' followed just before John's
death, although it was not to be Lennon's swan song.
   Bruce Springsteen has released three albums since 1980; Michael
Jackson two. In contrast, Lennon - or, more accurately, Ono - has
released five albums: ``Milk and Honey,'' ``Menlove Ave.,'' the
movie soundtrack ``Imagine,'' the ``John Lennon - Live in New
York'' collection and a boxed CD collection for Christmas '90.
   In addition, ``The Lost Lennon Tapes,'' featuring hours of
unreleased Lennon music, became a popular syndicated radio program.
   Ono has overseen all these projects.
   ``People ask me, `What would he have done in the '80s?' I say,
`Let's talk about what he HAS done in the '80s,' because he has
definitely,'' she said. ``In spirit, I think he's alive, and we're
getting the benefit.''
   Others charge Ono with turning her memories into millions
without concern for Lennon's image. A Fame magazine profile derided
her as ``The Merry Widow''; the now-defunct weekly 7 Days described
her as the decade's ``premier celebrity civil defendant.''
   Greed, insensitivity, egomania. None of Ono's alleged faults are
apparent in an interview.
   In October, a barefoot Ono greeted a visitor to the Dakota in a
high-ceilinged first-floor room with white carpet and black onyx
walls. Curled up on a chair, she serenely sipped herbal tea from a
mug decorated with a Lennon drawing of John and Yoko with the
inscription, ``Grow Old With Me.''
   The mug is one of an assortment of Lennon collectibles available
(by appointment only) from Bag One Arts Inc., the entity that
controls reproductions of Lennon's art work.
   Some of that black on white artwork - which includes doodles
jotted down on napkins, the margins of letters or stray scraps of
paper - has been colorized or redone in neon at Ono's order.
   ``People would ask if we had anything in color,'' says Lynne
Clifford, who runs Bag One for Yoko. ``And Yoko said, `I feel
confident enough to add the color myself. So she took the original
sketches and we made plates and she added colors.''
   Lithographs that sold for $400 four years ago have increased as
much as 10 times in value, she says, and new ones cost between $600
and $700.
   Although Bag One's gallery a few blocks from the Dakota deals
primarily in lithographs, it also sells the collectibles, including
$3 laminated bags that bear Lennon's drawings.
   ``Yoko wanted everybody to be able to walk away with
something,'' explained Clifford.
   Where does all the money go?
   ``Yoko is very funny about (saying) where the money goes. ...
But some goes to the Spirit Foundation,'' she said. The foundation,
established by Lennon and Ono before John's death, has contributed
to causes ranging from a home for drug addicted children to
bulletproof vests for police officers.
   Is there anything that will never bear Lennon's sketch-work?
   Socks, Clifford said. ``Yoko said she couldn't imagine people
walking around on John's drawings.''
   Back at the Dakota, Ono receives a familiar question: Is this
all commercialism? Has the iconoclastic ex-Beatle been sold out?
   She laughs.
   ``No. I didn't sell out John. And I'm sure John would be happy
I'm still keeping him out there. ... There's a commercial aspect,
yes, but I mean, why not? I was a partner, and I still feel that
I'm a partner.''
