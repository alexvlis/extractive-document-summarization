   Thousands of John Lennon fans, some
too young to remember the Beatles, swayed and sang along with songs
including his anthem ``Imagine'' at a hometown tribute.
   ``It's a great day, isn't it?'' Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, asked
the crowd. ``I think John would be happy, too.''
   At the close of the concert, she and son Sean, 14, wept and
hugged some of the musicians, who included B.B. King, Joe Cocker,
Roberta Flack, the Moody Blues, Hall and Oates, Wet Wet Wet and
Randy Travis.
   However, the turnout was only 15,000, according to police
estimates. Organizers had hoped for about 45,000. Tickets were $41
for the charity benefit concert, which featured a program of
Beatles and Lennon songs.
   The concert was televised in Britain and was to be rebroadcast
worldwide in October in a 50th birthday tribute to Lennon a decade
after his death.
   Cyndi Lauper, in a white minidress, sang ``Hey Bulldog,'' and
Dave Edmunds, backed by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra,
did the Beatles classic, ``A Day in the Life.''
   Soul singer Al Green was the opening act. His version of ``All
You Need is Love,'' turned into a singalong with the crowd, and
Kylie Minogue did ``Help.''
   American actor Christopher Reeve was among the hosts of the
concert.
   Ex-Beatles George Harrison, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr did
not attend, but McCartney and Starr made taped contributions.
   On tape, Starr performed ``I Call Your Name'' and said, ``John
had the biggest heart of any man I have ever met to this day. He
was a giving, loving, caring human being. He was crazy as well some
days _ but the guy would give you his heart.''
   Lennon's co-songwriter, Paul McCartney, said on his tape:
``Hello Liverpool, scene of many great memories, John, me and the
rest of the lads.'' The Beatles were raised in Liverpool and got
their start in the Merseyside bars.
   All the musicians assembled on stage for ``Give Peace a
Chance,'' as the enthusiastic audience sang along, waved and
clapped.
   The concert closed with a recording of Lennon singing
``Imagine,'' while giant screens showed a video featuring John and
Yoko.
   Proceeds are to go to the Spirit Foundation, the charity founded
by the Lennons in 1978, two years before Lennon was shot to death
in front of his apartment in New York City.
   Lennon was slain on Dec. 8, 1980, when he was 40. The confessed
killer, Mark Chapman, is serving a life prison sentence.
