   When celebrity biographer Albert Goldman began
digging into ``The Lives of John Lennon,'' his first move was to
mail a long, reverential request for help to Yoko Ono.
   ``She was Numero Uno, you've got to start with her. I sent her a
sincere letter, because at that time I was a true believer in
rock's greatest love story. ... I told her, `I'm in your corner,'''
Goldman recalled.
   Ono never responded. And after 1,200 interviews and 6{ years,
the dream was over for Goldman, his mythic view of Lennon the Great
altered.
   Expecting the best, Goldman claims to have uncovered the worst:
a volatile, debauched Lennon who evolved into the Howard Hughes of
rock 'n' roll, tucked in his Dakota bed for days at a time.
   That vision of the ex-Beatle has infuriated Lennon supporters,
family and friends and prompted charges of fiction writing; it also
taught Goldman _ who says he is a John Lennon fan _ a hard lesson.
   ``It doesn't pay to meet your idols. Just enjoy them; don't try
to see the reality,'' Goldman said. ``My books are a cold dose of
reality. You get in the Beatle shower, and suddenly the water goes
cold.''
   Goldman, whose past tell-all biographies dealt with Elvis
Presley and Lenny Bruce, remains unmoved by the hue and cry from
the music industry, from Ono and from Lennon's Beatle buddy, Paul
McCartney.
   ``My books are bad for business,'' Goldman said in a phone
interview from Munich, West Germany. ``They're bad for Paul's
business, bad for Yoko's business, back for the jive myth of rock
business. Those people have to hate me.''
   Myth-shattering is a not a bad thing, Goldman said. For example,
he cites Lennon's disillusioning meeting with Presley at Graceland
in 1965.
   ``John was very hooked into Elvis. Elvis was his measure of
success,'' said Goldman. ``And the myth of Elvis: awesome. But the
reality of Elvis: a mess.''
   Goldman also rejected the complaint raised by Ono, McCartney,
Julian Lennon and others that Lennon is an easy target to defame
because he's no longer around to answer the allegations.
   ``You can't say John lacks for defenders. And Yoko isn't dead.
Colonel Parker (Presley's manager) isn't dead. Ninety-five percent
of the people in my books aren't dead. They can do something about
it,'' said Goldman, his voice quickening.
   ``This business of making it easy for defending myself is
insane. I'm the target of scores of attacks. I can't imagine a
harder thing for an author.''
   Those attacks don't really bother him, unless they come from
someone who hasn't read ``The Lives of John Lennon,'' Goldman said.
   ``A lot of people already made up their minds. They hear Albert
Goldman, John Lennon, homosexuality _ bang, let him have it! I
resent people commenting on a book they haven't read, including
Yoko,'' the author said.
   Ono's reaction came on a nationally broadcast response to the
book. She labeled Goldman's version of life with the Lennons
``totally fiction'' and brought out Lennon's sons, Julian and
12-year-old Sean, to refute the biography.
   ``These giant promotions of Yoko are presented as honest
documentaries, when they're in-house documentaries,'' said Goldman,
who complimented Ono on a well-prepared show. ``She takes no
chances. This was another no-chance Yoko.''
   As for the sensational charges of bisexuality, drug abuse by
Yoko and John, wild drinking binges, anorexia and reclusiveness,
Goldman says it all fits together with the image of Lennon
presented by those who knew him.
   ``My thesis is John Lennon was a divided mind. Every yin had a
yang,'' said Goldman. ``There is nothing more natural than for John
to try the other side (sexually). That's just the kind of guy he
was. He wanted to try everything once.''
