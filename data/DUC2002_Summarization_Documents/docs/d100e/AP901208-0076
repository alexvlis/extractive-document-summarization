   Dozens of fans of rock legend and
former Beatle John Lennon gathered in the snow on a windy Saturday
for a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of his death.
   Liverpool's mayor, Dorothy Gavin, led Lennon devotees who laid
wreaths at the foot of a bronze statue of The Beatles in the city's
Cavern Walks shopping center.
   The center was built on the original site of the Cavern Club,
made famous when The Beatles played there in the 1960s, and has
become a place of pilgrimage.
   ``Give peace a chance,'' the title of one of singer-songwriter
Lennon's greatest hits, was the theme for the day.
   Many friends and followers of Lennon were present, including
Father Tom McKenzie, immortalized as Father MacKenzie in The
Beatles' l966 hit song ``Eleanor Rigby.''
   On Friday, a small group of invited guests had gathered at
Liverpool's Beatles Museum to watch Mrs. Gavin unveil a plaque
marking the 10th anniversary of Lennon's death.
   ``John was always a son of Liverpool and over the last 10 years
Liverpool has been very slow to recognize the fact that the Beatles
came from Liverpool,'' said Lennon biographer Ray Coleman after the
unveiling.
   ``It is right that a world figure like Lennon should be
recognized at last,'' said Coleman, author of ``John Lennon.''
   Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, were returning to their apartment
in New York's Dakota apartment building after a recording session
on Dec. 8, 1980, when Lennon was shot to death by Mark David
Chapman, a deranged fan to whom Lennon had given his autograph only
hours before. Lennon was 40.
   A spokesman for the Lennon family said Ms. Ono and the couple's
son, Sean, were in Europe and would spend the anniversary
privately.
   Journalist Andy Peebles, the last person to interview Lennon
before he was shot, said in an interview with Sky satellitetelevision news:
``Ten years on, it's a ghastly feeling to think
that you had spent ... seven hours ... with somebody you have been
a fan of for years, and I think I left ... thinking `This is great,
he's in really good shape.'''
   Peebles said late in 1980 that Lennon had just recovered from a
period when he had ``gone off the rails'' and his relationship with
Ms. Ono had suffered. ``But (when I saw him) they'd had the baby,
Sean had been born, and everything was great.''
