   Moslem extremists abducted a leading
businessman and an educator Friday and threatened to kill them, a
day after authorities killed six militants crossing into Pakistan
for arms and training, police said.
   Roads were blocked around Srinagar, where the hostages were
seized, and soldiers tightened security around the Kashmir Valley,
where the government launched a crackdown Jan. 20 on the Moslem
separatist movement.
   A telephone caller told a local reporter the abductors were also
holding a third hostage and all three men would be killed within 24
hours of a Monday afternoon deadline for releasing three jailed
militants.
   The caller claimed to speak for the Students Liberation Front, a
branch of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front fighting for autonomy
in the predominantly Moslem state. India itself is overwhelmingly
Hindu.
   Police sources, who demanded anonymity, and the telephone caller
both identified the new kidnap victims as Vice Chancellor Mushir
ul-Haq of Kashmir University and L.M. Khela, general manager of
Hindustan Machine Tools Co.
   The caller said ul-Haq's private secretary also was being held
hostage, but that could not be confirmed.
   Moslem separatists had warned Indian government officials to
leave Jammu-Kashmir state before April or ``face the consequences.''
   Police said the border violence took place in Kupwara district,
where at least 20 separatists tried to sneak into neighboring
Pakistan to receive military training and buy weapons. No details
were available.
   India says Pakistan trains and arms the militants in Kashmir, at
the far northern tip of India. Pakistan denies it. India and
Pakistan have fought two wars over the region since 1947, when both
nations won independence from Britain.
