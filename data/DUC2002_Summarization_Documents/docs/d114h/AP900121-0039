   Troops battled mobs of Moslem separatists in
the Kashmir city of Srinagar over the weekend, and at least 21
people were killed and 100 wounded before the fighting subsided
Sunday night, police said.
   Fifteen demonstrators were shot and killed Sunday, while six
were fatally wounded late Saturday night, according to Mohammad
Nomani, inspector general of Srinagar police. Militants defied a
curfew and continued trading intermittent shots with government
forces on Sunday, officials said.
   Witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the death
toll was at least 30, but that figure could not be confirmed.
   Nomani, speaking by telephone from Srinagar, the summer capital
of Jammu-Kashmir state, said the fighting tapered off late Sunday
afternoon as heavy rains lashed the city. But gunfire echoed
through the deserted streets until evening, one resident said,
requesting anonymity.
   ``They (the troops) are shooting at anything moving,'' he said.
   ``It is a disastrous situation out there,'' said Ramesh Kaul, a
hotel receptionist in Srinagar.
   At least 47 people have been killed in Jammu-Kashmir state since
the beginning of the year in violence triggered by Moslem militants
demanding independence or union with Islamic Pakistan.
   The separatists, led by the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, have
often attacked government offices and police officials.
   ``The situation is tense and dangerous,'' the state's chief
secretary, Moosa Raza, said in Jammu, the state's winter capital 95
miles south of Srinagar.
   Nomani said the police dispatched 25 cars with loudspeakers into
the city, to appeal to people to obey the curfew. The cars were
escorted by heavily armed troops from the paramilitary Central
Reserve Police Force, he said.
   A 24-hour curfew was imposed Saturday in a bid to quell
escalating violence and mass anti-India demonstrations in Srinagar
and nearby towns.
   But late Saturday, crowds defied curfew and surged into downtown
Srinagar chanting ``Indian dogs go back!'' and ``Long live
Pakistan!'' local reporters said.
   They said the paramilitary troops opened fire, killing two
people instantly and injuring 14. Four of them died later. As news
of the shootings spread, thousands of Moslem men poured out of
their homes, the reporters said.
   They said protesters recited verses from the Koran, the Moslem
holy book. Some took up a chant urging ``mujahedeen,'' or Islamic
holy warriors, to prepare for the final sacrifice in a showdown
with India's Hindu-dominated government.
   Jammu-Kashmir's former state chief minister, Farooq Abdullah,
issued a statement accusing authorities of letting loose a ``reign
of terror and repression.''
   Abdullah's Moslem-dominated National Conference Party is closely
aligned with the Congress Party of Rajiv Gandhi, the arch political
foe of Prime Minister V.P. Singh.
   Abdullah's government resigned Friday to protest the appointment
of Singh's nominee as the state's new governor and imposition of
governor's rule which amounts to tighter federal control over the
state.
   The curfew order was one of the first acts of the new governor,
Jagmohan, a tough administrator who had cracked down on Kashmiri
militants during an earlier stint as the state's governor.
Jagmohan, a Hindu who uses one name, took office Friday.
   Parts of Kashmir region are claimed by both India and Pakistan.
The dispute started when the state was partitioned between the two
countries when they gained independence from Britain in 1947.
   Srinagar's 800,000 people are moslty Moslem, as is a majority of
population in the Kashmir region. The Jammu region is predominantly
Hindu.
   India has often accused Pakistan of aiding the Kashmiri
militants, a charge Pakistan has denied.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only state with a Moslem majority in
predominantly Hindu India. Moslems make up 64 percent of the state
population of 5 million.
   Nationwide, Moslems comprise 12 percent of India's 880 million
people, while Hindus comprise 82 percent.
