   The government today imposed direct
federal rule in Kashmir, where Indian security forces are battling
to put down a rebellion by Moslem separatists.
   The action follows the killing Tuesday of at least 29 Moslem
militants by Indian security forces.
   In the Pakistani capital of Islamabad, meanwhile, India and
Pakistan opened negotiations today aimed at repairing relations
threatened by the rebellion in the disputed northern region.
   Relations between Pakistan and India worsened in January when
Indian soldiers cracked down on Moslem militants in Kashmir who are
seeking independence from India or union with Pakistan. At least
792 people have been killed in Kashmir since then. India has
accused Pakistan of arming and training the militants, a charge
Pakistan has denied.
   Before direct federal rule was imposed today on Jammu-Kashmir
state, it was administered temporarily by a governor, a federal
representative, since Jan. 18. The announcement of federal rule
reflected the belief that Jammu-Kashmir state was too unstable to
be run by an elected local government.
   On Tuesday, at least 29 militants were killed by Indian security
forces in Kashmir, the Moslem-dominated northern part of
Jammu-Kashmir state and the center of the secessionist campaign.
   Officials, who cannot be identified under briefing rules, said
21 militants were killed in a battle with the Border Security Force
in Poonch, 400 miles northwest of New Delhi. Hours later in the
same area, troops killed eight militants who slipped across the
border from Pakistan, said the officials.
   The guards also arrested four militants and seized 14 automatic
rifles, two machine guns and two rocket launchers, the officials
said.
   Indian officials maintain that Kashmiri militants regularly
cross over to Pakistan through the border and return by the same
route after reciving arms training. Pakistan denies it is training
or helping the militants, but calls the separatist struggle a fight
for self-determination.
   India and Pakistan have fought two previous wars over Kashmir,
in 1948 and 1965. Both were won by India.
   About 65 percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 6 million people are
Moslems, making it India's only Moslem majority state. Nationwide,
Moslems make up 12 percent of India's 880 million people. Hindus
make up 82 percent of the population.
   Kashmiri separatists earlier demanded union with Pakistan, an
Islamic country, but they have recently been fighting for total
independence and the status of a neutral country.
