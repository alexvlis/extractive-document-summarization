   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on
Thursday accused India of waging ``genocide'' in secession-minded
Kashmir and of trying to start a war with Pakistan to deflect
attention.
   Her remarks raised tensions further between India and Pakistan,
which have been feuding over Indian-controlled Kashmir. The two
countries, which have fought wars over the area in 1949 and 1965,
have in recent weeks again built up their military forces near the
common border.
   ``India is indulging in genocide,'' Ms. Bhutto said at a news
conference Thursday after returning from a weeklong tour of eight
Moslem countries in the Middle East and North Africa.
   ``Islamic scholars are being killed and innocent people are
being slaughtered. This is deplorable,'' said the prime minister.
   She was referring to the assassination of Maulvi Mohammad
Farooq, the top Moslem cleric in Indian Kashmir. During his funeral
procession Monday, Indian forces shot to death 58 people.
   Ms. Bhutto returned late Wednesday from visits to Iran, Turkey,
Syria, Jordan, North Yemen, Egypt, Libya and Tunisia, a
high-profile diplomatic offensive to drum up support for Pakistan's
stand on the Kashmir issue.
   Hindu-dominated India accuses Pakistan of arming and training
Kashmiri militants fighting for secession of Jammu-Kashmir, India's
only state with a Moslem majority. Pakistan, which is dominated by
Moslems, denies the Indian charge.
   Since the Indian government ordered a crackdown on the militants
in late January, more than 400 people have been killed.
   During her trip abroad, Ms. Bhutto said all her host countries
agreed that India and Pakistan needed to find a lasting political
settlement of the 43-year-old dispute.
   However, she added, ``If subjected to aggression, we would have
the full support of the Arab Islamic nations. Pakistan, I was
assured, would never be left alone.''
   ``We believe the threats to peace are grave,'' she said. ``We
cannot rule out the possibility of an armed conflict, but we do not
believe war is inevitable,'' she told reporters.
   Ms. Bhutto said she opposes an independent Kashmir. She said it
was not envisioned when India and Pakistan gained independence in a
1947 partition.
   The prime minister again called for talks between Pakistan and
India. She also said a neutral body should look into the charges
made by both sides.
   India has already rejected both suggestions.
