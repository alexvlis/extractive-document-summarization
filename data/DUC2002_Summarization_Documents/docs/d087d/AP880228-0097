   Time ran out for the U.S. athletes when
the Winter Olympics ended Sunday, with a team headed by Brent
Rushlaw a tick away from a U.S. bobsled medal and Dutch speed
skater Yvonne van Gennip a triple gold medalist with time to spare.
   The best America could do was six medals, its worst Winter Games
showing in 52 years. Two of the six were gold medals, won by Brian
Boitano in figure skating and Bonnie Blair in speed skating. Blair
also won a bronze in speed skating, making her America's only
double winner.
   The Olympics wrapped up Sunday evening with a rousing closing
ceremony before 60,000 people in McMahon Stadium. The 250 figure
skaters who performed included past and present medal winners as
well as young skaters from Albertville, France, site of the 1992
Winter Games, and Seoul, South Korea, site of this year's summer
Games.
   Athletes marched in carrying miniature Olympic torches, and
banners reading ``Until We Meet Again'' in eight languages were
draped along the top of the stands.
   Earlier Sunday, Rushlaw and his three team members missed
winning the first U.S. bobsled medal in 32 years when they was
beaten by .02 seconds for the bronze.
   Van Gennip took more than six seconds off her own world record
in the 5,000 meters to win her third gold medal. American Mary
Docter was 22.87 seconds behind. East Germans finished 2-3 in the
race.
   Finland won the hockey silver medal, handing the Soviets their
first loss of the Games, 2-1. The Soviets clinched the gold medal
Friday night, and America finished seventh for the second straight
time.
   In 1936, America won just four medals, but only 51 were
available then. This time, 138 medals were handed out.
   The Soviets finished first in both number of gold medals, with
11, and total medals, with 29, a record for the Winter Olympics.
East Germany's athletes won nine golds, 25 overall; while
Switzerland's team came in third in both gold medals, five, and
overall medals, 15.
   Four other teams also bested the United States in terms of
overall medals: Austria, West Germany, Finland and the Netherlands.
