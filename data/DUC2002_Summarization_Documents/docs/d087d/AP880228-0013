<HEAD>Debi Thomas A Disappointing Third In Figure Skating</HEAD>

   Debi Thomas' dream of Olympic gold
turned into disappointment Saturday as East Germany's Katarina Witt
won her second straight Olympic championship and Canadian Elizabeth
Manley took home the silver before a crowd of cheering countrymen.
   ``It's over. Back to school,'' said Thomas, who won the bronze
medal despite three faulty landings. ``I'm not going to make any
excuses. I was really skating well this week. It wasn't supposed to
happen, I guess. But I tried.''
   While the top two skaters in the world staged a shootout to
music from Bizet's ``Carmen,'' Manley was so sensational in the
freestyle that she finished first with seven judges. Combined with
a fourth in the compulsory figures and a third-place finish in the
short program earlier in the week, the performance put Manley in
second place.
   Witt, a three-time world champion from East Germany, became the
first repeat singles champion since Dick Button took Olympic gold
in 1948 and '52. Sonja Henie of Norway was the only woman to do it
before Witt, winning in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
   Thomas, of San Jose, Calif., the first black to win a U.S.
figure skating crown and the 1986 world champion, skated poorly
Saturday after doing well earlier in the Games.
   By contrast, Manley had the sellout crowd at the Olympic
Saddledome enraptured. They cheered, hooted and stamped their feet
when she finished hitting every element of her program.
   Jill Trenary of Minnetonka, Minn., finished fourth. She was
fifth heading into the long program, worth 50 percent of the
overall score.
   Thomas' bronze was the third figure skating medal here for the
United States. Brian Boitano won the men's crown, and a bronze in
pairs went to Jill Watson and Peter Oppegard.
   In addition to the three figure skating medals, the U.S. team
had three speed-skating medals: one each gold, silver and bronze.
   Speed skater Bonnie Blair, America's only double medalist, tried
again Saturday in the 1,500 meters but finished fourth, well off
the pace. She won the gold in the 500 and the bronze in the 1,000
meters.
   As the Olympics winded up its next-to-last day, the Soviet Union
had 27 medals, including 11 golds, while East Germany in second
place had 22, including nine golds.
