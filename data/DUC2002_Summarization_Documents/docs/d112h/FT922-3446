DOCUMENTS which show for the first time that both Mr Robert Maxwell and his
son Kevin were intimately involved in substantial purchases of shares in
Maxwell Communication Corporation, one of their own public companies, have
been obtained by the Financial Times.
Meanwhile, a director of a secretive Swiss trust, Mr Werner Rechsteiner, has
broken his silence and has admitted that transfers of MCC shares to his
trust, which are at the centre of an investigation by the Serious Fraud
Office, were made on the instructions of Robert Maxwell.
This is the first time that Mr Rechsteiner has given details of the
relationship between his mysterious trust, Yakosa Finanzierungs, and the
Maxwell family.
The FT has also obtained a letter and has seen a corroborating fax which
shows that Mr Kevin Maxwell was intimately involved in the purchase of 9m
shares by Yakosa and a further 16m shares by Servex, another Swiss Trust.
The MCC purchases by Yakosa and Servex are the object of an investigation by
the SFO into an alleged illegal scheme to support the MCC share price.
The SFO is also investigating whether Mr Robert Maxwell or Mr Kevin Maxwell
breached the Companies Act by failing to disclose the purchases of the
shares by the Swiss trusts.
If either had a financial interest in the Swiss trusts, the purchases should
have been disclosed under company law, because they were both directors of
MCC.
The documents demonstrate that Bishopsgate Investment Trust, a private UK
company controlled by the Maxwell family, provided Pounds 55.33m on behalf
of the two Swiss trusts so that they could pay for the MCC shares.
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, acted as broker to the deals.
Goldman's lawyers are convinced that it acted properly.
Mr Rechsteiner yesterday broke the silence he has maintained since Robert
Maxwell's death in November on the subject of his relationship with the
Maxwell family. He said MCC share purchases had been 'going on for some
time' through Yakosa. He denied that the shares were bought for Yakosa's
'own account'. He said the shares were bought for other 'foundations' and
then 'held for a certain time.'
He also stressed that ownership of the MCC shares no longer rested with
Robert Maxwell once they had been received by Yakosa: 'Yakosa is owned by
the Maxwell Foundation,' he said.
Mr Rechsteiner refused to say who controlled the Maxwell Foundation, which
is based in Liechtenstein, but said it was neither Robert nor Kevin Maxwell.
The FT has however obtained documents showing that Mr Kevin Maxwell was
closely involved in the process of paying for 25m MCC shares on behalf of
two Swiss trusts, Yakosa and Servex.
On May 29 last year, Mr Kevin Maxwell sent a fax to Mr Larry Wood, an
executive director of Goldman Sachs, telling him that two parcels of 12.5m
MCC shares each would be bought by the Swiss trusts with Pounds 55.33m
provided by BIT, a Maxwell private company. The fax, signed by Mr Maxwell,
said that the funds would be remitted to Goldman Sachs 'by Bishopsgate
Investment Trust PLC from its account at National Westminter Bank plc, 41
Lothbury'. Two other faxes sent by Mr Kevin Maxwell to Mr Wood on the same
day show that the former was equally involved in the other end of the
transaction, the sale of the 25m shares.
The Swiss trusts bought the shares, using Goldman as broker, from two
Maxwell pension funds, Maxwell Communication Pension Trustee (Works Scheme)
and Mirror Group Newspaper Pension Trustee (Works Scheme).
Each pension fund sold 12.5m shares at a price of 219.78p a share, or Pounds
27.47m in total. At 6.29pm on May 29, Mr Maxwell sent the two other faxes to
Mr Wood on behalf of the two pension funds.
As a director of MGPT and as a trustee of MCCPT, he told Mr Wood to pay each
pension fund what it was owed to the NatWest account of BIT, which Mr
Maxwell described as 'nominee' for the two pension funds.
In other words, he told Mr Wood that the shares were being bought for the
Swiss trusts with funds provided by BIT and that these funds should then be
sent by Goldman back to BIT.
In the event, on May 31, Goldman received the Pounds 55.3m by wire transfer
in its account at Barclays. Goldman then levied its commission and expenses
on the deal of Pounds 385,000 and wired the remainder back to BIT's NatWest
account.
