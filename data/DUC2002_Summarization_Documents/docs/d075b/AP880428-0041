   New treatments that stop a heart attack in its
tracks may help victims to get out of the hospital more quickly
than ever before, perhaps even three days after their attacks, a
study published today concludes.
   Doctors from the University of Michigan Medical Center studied
the effects of sending a few carefully selected heart patients home
early. They found that these people had no unusual complications,
got back to work sooner and had substantially lower medical bills.
   ``It was an extraordinarily safe strategy,'' said Dr. Eric J.
Topol, the study's director. ``There were no problems with any
serious events.''
   Topol said the early discharges were made possible by two recent
medical advances _ tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, and
angioplasty.
   When given quickly after a heart attack, TPA can dissolve clots
in the heart's arteries and minimize damage. Angioplasty can
produce similar results by opening up the clogged arteries with
tiny balloons.
   The report represents the latest in a steady three-decade trend
of sending heart attack patients home from the hospital after ever
shorter stays.
   However, the study in the New England Journal of Medicine said
more research is needed before the findings are widely adopted.
   In the 1950s, doctors often recommended that patients stay in
bed for one to two months after a heart attack. When President
Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered an uncomplicated heart attack in
1955, he spent seven weeks recovering in the hospital.
   However, doctors learned that long inactivity did more harm than
good. Patients got out of shape, developed blood clots and became
demoralized.
   In the 1960s, the stay was shortened to three weeks and in the
1970s to two weeks. Now, doctors typically keep heart attack
patients hospitalized seven to 10 days.
   In their paper, the doctors determined that 80 of the 507 heart
attack patients studied were healthy enough to be considered for
early discharge. None of them had irregular heart beats, chest pain
or heart failure. Treadmill tests showed no signs of heart attack
damage.
   Forty patients were sent home after three days, while the rest
stayed seven to 10 days. After six months of followup, none had
died, and the number of medical problems in both groups was similar.
   However, people in the early discharge group were able to return
to work about two weeks sooner than the others, and their medical
bills were significantly lower _ $12,546 versus $17,868.
   The researchers estimated that if 15 percent of all heart attack
patients were discharged after three days, the annual saving would
be at least $280 million.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Gregory D. Curfman, a deputy
editor of the journal, cautioned that the study was not large
enough to spot complications that might result from reducing
hospital stays.
   ``This single study,'' he wrote, ``is not sufficient to justify
sweeping changes in current management practices for all patients
who may at first appear to have uncomplicated'' heart attacks.
