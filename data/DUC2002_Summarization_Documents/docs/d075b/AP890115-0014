   Deaths from heart and blood vessel
disease dropped 24 percent over the past decade, but it remains by
far the nation's biggest killer, taking a life every 32 seconds, the
American Heart Association said Sunday.
   ``The good news is that we continue to see an improvement in the
death rate from the biggest killer of our population,'' said Dr.
Bernadine Healy of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, who is president
of the heart association.
   ``Those trends are dramatic and don't seem to be reversing,'' she
said. ``The bad news is that heart disease is still killing almost 1
million Americans a year, and we've got a long way to go.''
   The association released the statistics at its annual forum for
science writers.
   Experts attribute the decline in death rates to a combination of
healthier living habits, including fewer cigarettes and better food,
and improved medical treatment.
   ``The public ought to appreciate the progress that has been made
in heart disease over the past 20 years,'' said Dr. Myron L.
Weisfeldt of Johns Hopkins University. ``It's almost unbelievable.
There is almost no form of heart disease that we can't approach
without meaningful treatment.''
   However, Weisfeldt, who is president-elect of the heart
association, also cautioned that much work remains, both in
improving care and encouraging people to take better care of their
health.
   ``I believe we can prevent at least 50 percent of the ischemic
heart disease in the United States by the year 2000 if we stop
smoking, get cholesterol treated if it's above 220, and identify and
treat hypertension,'' he said.
   Ischemic heart disease is the clogging of blood vessels that feed
the heart. It underlies most heart attacks, the single most lethal
heart ailment.
   Association figures indicated that in 1986 _ the most recent year
for which there are statistics _ an estimated 978,500 Americans died
from heart attacks, strokes and other diseases of the heart and
blood vessels. Cancer, the No. 2 killer, took 466,000 lives.
   Between 1976 and 1986, the death rate from all forms of
cardiovascular disease fell 24 percent. It declined 28 percent for
heart attacks and 40 percent for strokes.
   The association's figures show that more than one in four
Americans suffers some form of cardiovascular disease, and almost
half of those eventually die from it.
   About 60 percent of the heart attack deaths occur before the
victim reaches the hospital. Studies show that about half of all
heart attack victims wait more than two hours before getting to an
emergency room.
   Weisfeldt said a major health goal is getting people to go to the
hospital within three or four hours of the first sign of heart
attacks. During this period, there is still time to give them drugs
to dissolve the blood clots that are causing their heart attacks.
This treatment can save lives and reduce the disability of heart
attacks.
   Other major goals, he said, include finding ways to improve the
effectiveness of angioplasty, a technique that uses balloons to open
clogged heart arteries, and finding surgical and medical techniques
to identify and protect people at risk of cardiac arrest.
   The heart association estimates that cardiovascular disease will
cost $88.2 billion this year in medical expenses and lost wages.
   Among other statistics released by the association:
   _The most common cardiovascular disease is high blood pressure,
which affects 60 million Americans.
   _About 200,000 of the deaths from cardiovascular disease each
year occur in people under age 65.
   _There were 1,418 heart transplants in 1987, almost nine times as
many as in 1983.
   _About 2.5 million Americans have angina, the chest pain
resulting from clogged heart arteries. About 300,000 new cases occur
annually.
   _As many as 1.5 million Americans will have heart attacks this
year.
