<LEADPARA>  The camera pans across the ornate furnishings of President Mikhail Gorbachev's
Kremlin office, then moves in for a tight shot of three men hunched over a
coffee table, conferring in the low voices of conspirators.;   "Then it's
agreed," Gorbachev says, sitting back and raising his eyes to the portrait of
Lenin hanging on the opposite wall. "It's the only way." The two others nod in
assent.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Cut to a row of dour Communists in ill-fitting gray suits announcing
Gorbachev's illness and a palace coup. The camera zooms in on the impassive
faces of the two men last seen in Gorbachev's office.;   What is going on
here?;   OK, it's a hackneyed device that would only work in the movies. But
then, this week's events in the Soviet Union have all the makings of a spy
thriller.;   Kremlinologists who dabble in conspiracy theories are working
overtime, though they insist that their darkest imaginings be clearly labeled
"pure speculation.";   "Once you have a palace coup, the possibilities are
endless," said Robert Conquest, a senior research fellow at the Hoover
Institution. "Russian politics are full of very strange things.";   For all we
know, Conquest joked, Gorbachev could be injected with drugs to change his
personality or KGB scientists could produce a body-double to impersonate him.;
  "His friends would know, but would you or I?" Conquest said. "That would be
going a bit far.";   A more intriguing scenario has Gorbachev conspiring with
the coup plotters to engineer a transformation of the Soviet political
landscape. The thinking goes like this:;   With his popularity at rock bottom,
Gorbachev, a lifelong creature of the KGB, hatches a false coup in order to
step out of the way while hard-liners and liberals battle each other. The coup
falls apart and Gorbachev triumphantly returns with a level of legitimacy he
never enjoyed before.;   The theory could explain the apparent bungling of the
coup plotters, said author Joseph Finder, whose 1991 novel, "The Moscow Club,"
foreshadowed many of the elements of the current crisis.;   Finder, who said
he did not subscribe to the scenario, nonetheless pointed out that tanks did
not begin to roll until hours after Gorbachev's supposed arrest. Russian
President Boris Yeltsin was not arrested, and Leningrad was left alone.;  
Speculation was not unique to Kremlin watchers in the United States.;  
Theorizing was rampant in the streets of Moscow on Tuesday, said San Francisco
businesswoman Kimberly Getto, who sent a long fax detailing speculation,
fueled by the fact that many of the tanks encircling the Russian parliament
building had no ammunition. Gorbachev did not want bloodshed, according to the
theory.;   The Democratic Reform Movement, headed by former Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze, Gorbachev's longtime ally, floated the same possibility
in a statement Monday.;   "It's highly implausible, but not to be excluded,
that Gorbachev himself agreed to a withdrawal, thinking he'd show them they
still needed him," said Norman Naimark, director of Stanford's Center for
Russian and East European Studies. "The degree of connivance is difficult to
gauge."  </TEXT>
