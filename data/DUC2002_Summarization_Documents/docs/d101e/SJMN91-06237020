<TEXT>     Yeltsin, the triumphant leader of the resistance against this week's
military coup, has drastically tipped the balance of power here, showing
himself to be at least the political equal, if not the master, of Gorbachev.
In a symbol of the new order, the Russian tricolor, the banner of the
anti-coup resistance, flew over the gates of the Kremlin alongside the red
Soviet flag for the first time since the rise of the Bolshevik state.;   In a
joint appearance with Gorbachev in the Russian parliament, broadcast live on
Soviet television, Yeltsin made it clear that the Soviet president can
maintain a semblance of authority only if he agrees to share power and
intensify the march toward a democratic political system and a market
economy.;   "And now for a bit of relaxation," Yeltsin said, interrupting
Gorbachev's speech. "Let me sign a decree suspending the activity of the
Russian Communist Party.";   Gorbachev, who has insisted the party is still
capable of reform, stammered a bit and then said, "Boris Nikolayevich, Boris
Nikolayevich . . ." With an expression that was half-smile, half-sneer,
Yeltsin broke in. "It's been signed," he said definitively, and the deputies
broke out in cheering and applause. Gorbachev struggled to explain his own
position, but he seemed at a loss.;   Yeltsin, who clearly relished his
emotional and political control of the parliament session, also played a
critical role in selecting the new heads of the KGB, the Defense Ministry and
the Interior Ministry police, which until now have been bastions of opposition
to reform. Flouting protocol, Yeltsin was the first to announce the
appointments while speaking at a mass rally Friday morning outside KGB
headquarters.;   New appointees; Former Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin will
head the KGB, Gen. Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the air force chief, becomes defense
minister and former Russian Interior Minister Victor Barannikov will be the
union's interior minister. All three men took a clear stand against the coup
and are expected to move quickly to reform the key institutions they now
head.;   Gorbachev also fired Alexander Bessmertnykh as foreign minister.
Although Bessmertnykh said he had refused to go along with the coup leaders,
Gorbachev said he had information that his top diplomat had been "maneuvering,
or at least did not take a firm stand.";   Bessmertnykh reacted with
"bitterness," according to the Tass news agency, and claimed that he had
refused to join the conservative uprising, even though coup leader and former
KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov had told him, "We need a liberal among us.";   In
both Moscow and Leningrad, city officials ordered police to seal off Communist
Party headquarters. Moscow Mayor Gavril Popov said investigators had to make a
thorough search of party buildings and documents to determine the scope of the
coup and its participants. Across the country, Communist Party leaders who
opposed the coup quit their party posts, and some who supported it, such as
Latvian party leader Alfred Rubiks, were arrested.;   The leader of the
Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexei II, said the coup meant the end of
communist ideology in the country. "God has saved Russia," he declared.;   As
Gorbachev struggled during the 90-minute session of the Russian parliament, he
called for "maturity and balance" in judging the conspirators and said, "Let's
not have a witch hunt.";   Greeted by protesters; From the moment that
protesters outside the Russian parliament building greeted the arrival of
Gorbachev's limousine with shouts of "Resign! Resign!" it was clear that the
Soviet president was not about to get a warm homecoming from those who played
a key role in rescuing him.;   The Russian deputies -- and Yeltsin especially
-- were alternately sarcastic and aggressive. When Gorbachev had trouble at
one point explaining one development in the coup, Yeltsin broke in like an
exasperated schoolmaster. "Sometimes Mikhail Sergeyevich forgets things," he
said.;   Yeltsin also seemed eager to impress on Gorbachev just how thoroughly
he had been betrayed by his own ministers and presumed allies. He handed
Gorbachev the minutes of a closed Council of Ministers meeting held last
Monday during which all of the more than 20 ministers present -- with one or
two exceptions -- supported the coup and the State Committee for the State of
Emergency set up by the putsch leaders.;   "I haven't read this yet," said
Gorbachev in an attempt to put off the matter.;   "Go ahead," Yeltsin
insisted. "Read it now.";   And Gorbachev did, reeling off the names of all of
the ministers who had for so long mouthed the slogans of reform and then
stabbed him in the back.;   "This whole government has got to resign,"
Gorbachev said with a degree of despair in his voice. "I must say this has
been a great drama for me, a severe trial.";   Retribution for Yeltsin;
Yeltsin seemed to take extraordinary relish in this Shakespearean drama of
betrayal and retribution. It had been Gorbachev who ordered Yeltsin out of a
hospital bed in 1987 to face a vengeful meeting of the Moscow Communist Party
Committee. At that session, one speaker after another attacked Yeltsin for
"political immaturity" and other sins for daring to criticize the party and
its Politburo.;   And it was Gorbachev in 1990 who came to the Russian
parliament to call on deputies to vote against Yeltsin as their chairman.
Although this seemingly endless political saga of two reformers who can only
struggle to find a common language seemed at an end this spring when they
began negotiations on a new Union Treaty, it is clear that their relationship
will likely remain the great floating opera of Soviet politics.;   Gorbachev
said he and Yeltsin had also agreed to assume each other's duties in an
emergency.;   "If one or another gets in the situation when he cannot even
give orders, like what happened now, his rights and responsibilities are
automatically taken by the other," Gorbachev said.;   It appeared that the
move would have to be temporary and could be made permanent only with
legislative consent. Soviet law makes the vice president the next-in-line.
Gennady Yanayev invoked that law in the coup while declaring Gorbachev
physically incapacitated.;   The conspirators themselves are now in jail and
facing interrogation. Gorbachev said the leaders of the junta "tried to turn
us all into chopped meat" and they should be prosecuted without "hesitation or
forgiveness.";   Soviet Prime Minister Valetin Pavlov has been arrested for
helping to lead the coup, Soviet and Russian television reported today.;  
Pavlov was one of the eight officials in the committee that ousted Gorbachev
from power, but he was reportedly taken ill on Sunday night when the coup
began.;   He has been under police guard in a hospital since Gorbachev
regained power Wednesday.;   Speculation of guilt also turned on another key
figure in the old Gorbachev government. According to Yeltsin, Supreme Soviet
Chairman Anatoly Lukyanov has been ousted for taking part in the coup, but
that has not been confirmed.  </TEXT>
