<LEADPARA>  Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was prepared to head back to Moscow today
to reclaim power after the hard-line coup against him collapsed and its
leaders reportedly fled.;   Outside the Russian parliament, which served as
the headquarters for resistance led by Boris Yeltsin, rejoicing crowds cheered
and waved flags as the coup ended. Soldiers, their withdrawing tanks strewed
with flowers, waved at television cameras.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Gorbachev was set to board a plane in the Crimea, where he was vacationing
at the time of Monday's coup, for the two-hour flight to Moscow, said a deputy
to Russian Defense Minister Konstantin Kobets. Earlier reports that the plane
had already taken off were incorrect, officials said.;   The Soviet leader, in
a statement for radio and television, said he was fully in command of the
situation and that the coup leaders would bear "full responsibility" for their
actions.;   In the United States, President Bush hailed Gorbachev's return to
power and said the coup leaders had "underestimated the power of the people,
underestimated what a taste of freedom and democracy brings.";   The three-day
coup, one of the most tumultuous developments in recent Soviet history,
unraveled in a series of swift and dramatic developments today:;   (check)
Tanks and armored personnel carriers moved away from the Russian parliament,
scene of the worst violence of the coup. A 2 1/2-milelong column of tanks and
trucks headed out of Moscow.;   (check) The leaders of the national
legislature demanded Gorbachev's reinstatement. The full legislature nullified
the coup leaders' emergency decrees.;   (check) Press restrictions were
lifted. "I'm sorry, comrades, but I'm very excited!" said a Soviet TV
announcer, grinning broadly after he was allowed for the first time to
criticize the coup leaders' actions.;   (check) The Communist Party,
apparently seeking to salvage its own image, denounced the takeover.;  
(check) In the secessionist Baltic republics, which had borne the brunt of the
post-coup crackdown, some Soviet troops began returning to their permanent
bases. Latvia joined neighbor Estonia today in declaring immediate
independence from the Soviet Union.;   The coup's failure could deal a fatal
blow to organized, high-level efforts to thwart reform drives in the Soviet
Union by Gorbachev and Yeltsin and significantly alter the balance of power
that has characterized Soviet power for the six-year Gorbachev era.;   The
country's future course depends, however, on who remains in power. Although
Yeltsin supported Gorbachev during the coup, the two men maintain different
approaches to Soviet reforms.;   Yeltsin addressed the Russian parliament
today and said the Soviet Union had just "gone through a most tragic moment in
its history, and perhaps the most tragic moment.";   Gorbachev's foreign
minister, Alexander Bessmertnykh, who had dropped out of sight during the
coup, reappeared today and called the takeover a page in Soviet history that
"has got to be turned.";   The national legislature invalidated all decrees
made by the coup leaders, national lawmaker Yuri Karyakin told the Russian
legislature. Karyakin said the legislature's executive council demanded
Gorbachev's return to power.;   With the coup's demise, the Communist Party
moved to salvage its own credibility. It called the takeover unconstitutional
and demanded a meeting with Gorbachev, the party chief, the official news
agency Tass said. The party renounced any connection with the coup leaders.;  
Thousands of people had kept up their vigil at the Russian parliament building
after overnight clashes with Soviet troops that left at least four dead. They
cheered when the announcement of the coup committee's departure came over a
loudspeaker.;   "This shows the strength of our democracy," said Leonid
Abramtsov, who was marching with a band of teen-agers waving the red, white
and sky-blue flag of the Russian republic.;   The plane reportedly carrying
the coup leaders was said to be headed to the city of Bishkek, formerly called
Frunze, the capital of Kirgizia, 2,100 miles southeast of Moscow, according to
Radio Russia, which speaks for Yeltsin. It was not immediately known why the
coup leaders would travel to Kirgizia.;   But sources at the airport told the
Associated Press that only KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov was on a plane, and it
was headed to the Crimea. He reportedly was accompanied by Communist Party No.
2 leader Vladimir Ivashko.;   The republic-run Russian Information Agency said
Vice President Gennady Yanayev, the nominal head of the coup committee, was
still in his Kremlin office. The report could not be independently confirmed,
and the discrepancies could not be clarified.;   Despite the force brought to
bear by the coup leaders, they were unable to dislodge Yeltsin from the
Russian parliament, where he rallied the opposition, to enforce the curfew, or
prevent large demonstrations nationwide.;   The state of emergency was
declared after hard-line elements in the military and Communist Party ousted
Gorbachev, declaring he was ill.;   The junta had seemed unable to cope with
tens of thousands of people who erected barricades around Yeltsin's stronghold
in the parliament.;   There were also huge anti-coup demonstrations in Moscow,
Leningrad, Kishiniev and other cities, as well as strikes by coal miners in
Siberia.;   Early today, before the coup fell apart, columns of tanks and
armored personnel carriers had moved around central Moscow. One patrol of the
armored vehicles was trapped by furious demonstrators just after midnight as
it tried to break through a barricade.;   Two people were confirmed shot or
crushed to death as the vehicles tried to fight their way through, and
witnesses said a third person was killed. A Russian republic official, Col.
Viktor Samailov, told the independent news agency Interfax that four people
were shot or crushed to death in the clash.  </TEXT>
