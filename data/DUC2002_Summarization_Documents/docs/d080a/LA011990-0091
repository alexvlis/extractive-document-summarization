Ray Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were found not guilty 
Thursday of molesting children at the family-run McMartin Pre-School in 
Manhattan Beach, a verdict which brought to a close the longest and costliest 
criminal trial in history. 
</P>
<P>
An eight-man, four-woman jury -- 10 of the members parents themselves -- 
acquitted the Buckeys of 52 counts of molestation after deliberating for nine 
weeks over evidence that had been presented over the course of more than two 
years. The jury reported it was deadlocked on 13 remaining counts, and a 
mistrial was declared on those allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Buckey, 31, left the courtroom without comment -- free on his own 
recognizance until a decision is reached on whether the district attorney will 
retry him on the 13 undecided counts. But his 63-year-old mother and 
co-defendant reacted with anger. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gone through hell and now we've lost everything," she said outside the 
court. "My concern was for my son and what they've done to him . . . because my 
son would never harm a child." 
</P>
<P>
Most jurors said later that they believed the children who testified had been 
molested, but that the prosecution had failed to prove beyond a reasonable 
doubt that the Buckeys were culpable. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not convinced that he (Ray Buckey) is innocent," said juror Sally 
Cordova, 27, a supermarket checker. "But it was not proven to me that he did 
it. Whether I believe he did it and whether it was proven are very different." 
</P>
<P>
The end of the case came in a tense and crowded courtroom. The Buckeys, who 
spent years in jail as the case progressed through the judicial system, had sat 
silently, staring straight ahead, as the jury filed into the room shortly 
before 10:30 a.m. and the gallery of reporters and spectators grew quiet in 
anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
"All the verdicts are the same," said Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William 
Pounders, handing them to his court clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Clerk Stan Ferrell listed the counts numerically and then, reading from the 
verdict form, delivered in a single, almost anti-climactic sentence the 
historic trial's close: 
</P>
<P>
"We the jury in the above entitled actions find the defendants not guilty." 
</P>
<P>
The quiet of the courtroom was split by a few gasps and sobs. At first, the 
defendants remained stoic, then their eyes began to rim with tears. Ray 
Buckey's lower lip quivered. His mother dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief. 
They said nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Peggy McMartin Buckey insisted she was not bitter. "I knew God would 
set my son and me free because we have done nothing," she said as she was 
driven away. Her optimism was not matched by her son, however, who she said had 
"had fear, definitely," about what the jury would decide. 
</P>
<P>
"I held his hand," Buckey's mother said after the verdicts were announced, "and 
I told him: 'I told you, Ray,' and he felt like he wanted to cry but he 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
The acquittals concluded the longest criminal trial in history, a case that 
stemmed from a 2 1/2-year-old's report to his mother six years ago that he had 
been sodomized at his school by a "Mr. Ray." The case ultimately cost taxpayers 
more than $15 million, altered scores of lives and careers, and provided a 
national focal point for the issue of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Pounders said he was not surprised by the verdicts: "I found it difficult 
to determine how they would view the evidence in the first place. I thought 
that based on the evidence that was presented, the jury could do almost 
anything and still find rational support for it. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult to test the credibility of children, and when you go 
beyond that, the natural tendency for adults is to look for corroboration. It 
was very difficult to find corroboration in this case." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the case was worth its cost in money, lives and stress, Pounders said 
he thinks society benefited from the case. 
</P>
<P>
"People will be much more alert to the possibility of this type of offense 
taking place at preschool and at schools," Pounders said. "People are no longer 
dropping their children off and walking away blindly. They look back. They 
check things out more." 
</P>
<P>
In the crowded courthouse hallways, parents of alleged victims lashed out at 
the prosecutors for bungling the case and insisted that their children had not 
been well served by the judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
"The system doesn't allow us to protect kids," said the father of two alleged 
victims. "I have no doubt these children were abused. 
</P>
<P>
Said a tearful mother: "I guess maybe it's OK to (molest) kids! I can't believe 
this." 
</P>
<P>
The children themselves reacted calmly and stood by their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
"We all know that we are telling the truth," said a 15-year-old boy who had 
testified. "No matter what the jury says, whatever anybody says, this is the 
truth. We were molested." 
</P>
<P>
Another of the children said that, when the clerk read "not guilty" on the 
verdict form, "my stomach just hollowed out. I was beyond tears. Those words 
will stick with me probably the rest of my life. I'll never forget those two 
words." 
</P>
<P>
Jurors were critical of the prosecutors' methods. In particular, they cited the 
prosecution's reliance on videotapes of controversial pretrial interviews of 
the young witnesses at a Los Angeles child-abuse center. They also criticized 
the Manhattan Beach Police Department's decision, early in the investigation, 
to send out form letters to parents announcing an investigation had begun and 
soliciting information. 
</P>
<P>
"The children," said juror John Breese, 51, a biomedical technician, "were 
never allowed to say in their own words what happened to them. That was 
crucial." 
</P>
<P>
Said jury foreman Luis Chang, an electrical engineer: "The key evidence that 
swayed me was the interview tapes. They were too biased, too leading. That's 
the main crux of it." 
</P>
<P>
All said they had entered the jury deliberation room with open minds, not only 
because the judge had so instructed, but also because the disjointed testimony 
had left them confused. 
</P>
<P>
"I went into the jury room as confused and uncertain as I was the day I first 
sat in the jury box the first day of this trial," said Brenda Williams, 38, a 
Pacific Bell service representative. "I felt I had missed out on something, 
maybe I had dozed off during some important testimony and I was hoping some of 
my fellow jurors had something in their notes that I didn't have in mine that 
would make it all come together." 
</P>
<P>
Said juror Mark Bassett, 33, a computer specialist: "We just didn't really know 
what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty Lael Rubin, who prosecuted the case, said a decision has not 
been made about whether to pursue the 13 counts involved in a mistrial. These 
counts involve 12 molestation charges against Ray Buckey, and a conspiracy 
count that accused both him and his mother. The conspiracy count against Peggy 
McMartin Buckey was dismissed outright Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We ultimately must respect the jury's decision," Rubin said, "even though I 
personally disagree with it. 
</P>
<P>
"The system worked well for them," she said in reference to the Buckeys. "They 
were lucky. I just hope to God that years from now we don't hear about Ray 
Buckey molesting children." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner blamed the criminal justice system 
for the length of the trial, and said he backs two state court-reform 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
"Too much time and too much money has gone into this case. This is insane. The 
very idea a case can go to trial for 2 1/2 years and there can be a rational 
result is preposterous. The McMartin case is the very worst example that we 
have, period. But it does not stand alone." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys Dean Gits and Danny Davis were beaming after the verdict 
announcement. "I feel great," Gits said, indicating he had found hope that the 
decision would go the defense way last week when the jury informed the judge it 
was reaching deadlock on a conspiracy count. 
</P>
<P>
With the acquittal, Pounders freed more than $3 million worth of property that 
had been posted by Buckey supporters as bail last year so that he could be 
released after five years in jail. Buckey's mother had been free on a smaller 
bail amount earlier after spending nearly two years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
The McMartin case -- which included allegations not only of rape, sodomy, oral 
copulation, and other sex crimes, but also of pornographic photography 
sessions, "naked games," field trips away from the school for illicit purposes, 
animal mutilation, threats and satanic-like ritual and sacrifice -- began in 
the fall of 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The mother of a 2 1/2-year-old complained to Manhattan Beach police that her 
son had been sodomized by "Mr. Ray," and subsequent physical examinations 
indicated he had been sexually abused. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey was arrested in September of that year, but was released as the 
investigation continued and widened to include six other teachers at the 
Manhattan Beach nursery school, among them his grandmother, dozens of 
"uncharged suspects," and eight other South Bay nursery schools. 
</P>
<P>
The Manhattan Beach Police Department sent a form letter to hundreds of 
McMartin school parents asking for information, and a wave of hysteria swept 
through the affluent beach town. Many parents took their youngsters to 
Children's Institute International, a Los Angeles child-abuse diagnostic and 
treatment center, for evaluation; the majority were told that their children 
had been victimized. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1984, Ray Buckey was rearrested, along with his sister, Peggy Ann 
Buckey, his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, his grandmother, Virginia McMartin, 
and teachers Betty Raidor, Babette Spitler and Mary Ann Jackson. A county grand 
jury had indicted them on 115 counts; that indictment was superseded in May by 
a criminal complaint charging them with 208 counts involving 41 children. 
</P>
<P>
The case was hastily filed, and it was flawed from the beginning. Then-Dist. 
Atty. Robert Philibosian, running for reelection, and the media, which caught 
wind of the investigation, were pressing for action. 
</P>
<P>
Children's Institute International, deluged with concerned parents, enlisted 
untrained therapists to assess the children, resulting in videotaped interviews 
filled with leading and suggestive questions that would later prove 
embarrassing to the prosecution and provide the defense with grounds for 
claiming that the alleged victims had been programmed to believe that they had 
been molested. 
</P>
<P>
Hysteria grew. Hundreds of South Bay children had fallen victim to a nationwide 
conspiracy and pornography ring, it was alleged, and an angry mob spray-painted 
"Ray Must Die" on the walls of the nursery school and began digging up an 
adjacent vacant lot in search of animal remains. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-month preliminary hearing, which began in the fall of 1984, was marked 
by frequent shouting matches between three prosecutors, nine defense attorneys 
and Municipal Judge Aviva Bobb, and lengthy questioning of child witnesses that 
lasted in one instance for 16 days. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles was riveted by the daily images of youngsters clambering atop a 
booster chair in their Sunday best to face their alleged molesters. They 
munched cookies, swigged root beer, and sometimes sobbed as they told of their 
experiences at McMartin. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most poignant moment came when an 8-year-old girl told in a wispy 
voice of having been raped, photographed, tied up and placed in a dark closet 
by her teachers five years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Bobb ordered all seven defendants to stand trial on 135 charges, 
telling each, "The court believes there is sufficient cause to believe you are 
guilty." The remaining charges had been dropped after only 14 of the scheduled 
child witnesses came forward to testify. One child was allowed to testify by 
closed-circuit television, under a new state law passed especially for the 
McMartin case. 
</P>
<P>
But a week later, in January, 1986, the new district attorney, Ira Reiner, who 
had inherited the case from Philibosian, dropped charges against five of the 
seven defendants, citing "incredibly weak evidence" and deciding to proceed 
only against Ray Buckey and his mother. 
</P>
<P>
The trial itself began with jury selection in April, 1987. Testimony began in 
July. The scope of the trial was narrowed again when several parents decided 
not to allow their children to testify. Eventually nine of 11 named victims 
took the witness stand, all sticking to their earlier accounts, but for minor 
inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
Toddlers at the time of their alleged abuse and now nearing adolescence, they 
described in graphic detail the abuses they say they suffered at the hands of 
the Buckeys. Their testimony was often raw and unsettling. The children's 
allegations were supported by medical evidence testified to by physicians. 
</P>
<P>
But both Buckey and his mother also took the stand and staunchly maintained 
their innocence. And fellow teachers, including former defendants, testified 
that no improprieties in the small school could have occurred without their 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution sought to show that the children repeatedly had been abused 
sexually, but silenced for years by threats, and also that their child-like 
efforts to tell their parents that something was wrong had been ignored or 
misinterpreted. 
</P>
<P>
The defense contended that nothing untoward happened at the school, but that 
the children were programmed by therapists to believe that something bad had 
happened to them. It claimed that their stories defied common sense and that 
the medical evidence was unreliable and perhaps fabricated. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-year-long case was marked by twists and turns and tragedies, prompting 
the judge to comment that it had "poisoned" everyone it had touched. Day after 
day, it was punctuated with the unexpected and bizarre: 
</P>
<P>
* Ailing family matriarch Virginia McMartin, now 82, wrote poetry, conducted 
colorful hallway interviews and tested the judge's patience with such outbursts 
as, "This awful court. These awful people. These awful lies." 
</P>
<P>
* Therapist Kee MacFarlane, who conducted many of the interviews in which 
children first disclosed that they had been molested, came under fire when it 
was revealed not only that she had minimal previous experience in the field but 
also that she was involved romantically with the television newsman who broke 
the story. 
</P>
<P>
* Former prosecutor Glenn Stevens became a key defense witness after leaking 
information that he believed that the defendants were innocent, and signed a 
movie contract to tell his revised version of events. 
</P>
<P>
* A 10-year-old boy, testifying at the preliminary hearing, identified everyone 
from the city attorney and a movie star to a priest and four nuns as among his 
molesters, and painted a picture of marching with his classmates to a cemetery 
where they dug up corpses with shovels and pick-axes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
KEY FIGURES IN THE McMARTIN TRIAL 
</P>
<P>
THE JUDGE: 
</P>
<P>
WILLIAM R. POUNDERS, 50 -- Superior Court judge since 1985. A former state 
prosecutor who also did appellate work, he was assigned to the case after the 
litigants rejected three other judges as prejudiced. An intellectual who often 
uses expressions derived from his Air Force experience building nuclear 
missiles, Pounders' strengths are meticulous organization and an extensive 
knowledge of the law, which he augments with a 3-by-5 index card file system, 
as well as a new computer. A graduate of Loyola Law School, he is widely 
respected as a fair and thorough judge. 
</P>
<P>
THE DEFENDANTS: 
</P>
<P>
RAY BUCKEY, 31 -- Key defendant in the McMartin case, Buckey is the grandson of 
nursery school founder Virginia McMartin and son of co-defendant Peggy McMartin 
Buckey. A quiet man who is a college dropout and has admitted having problems 
with drugs and alcohol, Buckey worked briefly at a San Diego child care center 
before joining his family's enterprise in Manhattan Beach. He was charged on 52 
counts of child molestation involving 11 children and one count of conspiracy 
shared with his mother. He denied all allegations against him. 
</P>
<P>
PEGGY MCMARTIN BUCKEY, 63 -- Co-defendant in the McMartin case, she both 
directed the Virginia McMartin Pre-School and taught there. She also hired her 
son as a teacher. A talkative, religious woman who drew pictures throughout the 
tedious proceedings and crocheted during breaks, she was charged on 12 counts 
of molestation involving four children and one count of conspiracy. She has 
maintained that neither she nor any member of her staff engaged in improper 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
THE PROSECUTORS: 
</P>
<P>
LAEL R. RUBIN, 47 -- Co-prosecutor. A former high school English teacher, Rubin 
was a latecomer to the legal profession, graduating from the University of West 
Los Angeles School of Law in 1978. She quickly distinguished herself after 
joining the district attorney's office, successfully prosecuting "Black Cathy" 
Wilson for child pornography, Harry Sassounian for the assassination of the 
Turkish consul general in Los Angeles, and his brother, Harout Sassounian, for 
firebombing the Turkish consul general's house. She is the only original 
prosecutor remaining on the McMartin case. 
</P>
<P>
ROGER J. GUNSON, 50 -- Co-prosecutor. A 20-year veteran of the district 
attorney's office and a graduate of UCLA Law School, the soft-spoken, 
unassuming Gunson most recently served as head deputy in the Sex Crimes and 
Child Abuse Division. He successfully prosecuted film director Roman Polanski 
for unlawful sex with a minor, and Susan Brophy, wife of former state 
assemblyman Bill Brophy, for vehicular manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
THE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS: 
</P>
<P>
DANIEL G. DAVIS, 43 -- Defense attorney representing Ray Buckey. A graduate of 
the University of Texas law school, Davis was a civil attorney with the firm of 
Lillick McHose &amp; Charles for two years before turning to criminal law. 
Initially hired by the Buckey family, he was appointed to finish the case after 
their money ran out. He owns the now-defunct nursery school. 
</P>
<P>
DEAN R. GITS, 45 -- Defense attorney representing Peggy McMartin Buckey. A 
gentlemanly, cum laude graduate of the William Mitchell College of Law in St. 
Paul, Gits describes himself as "a simple country lawyer from Minnesota." Known 
for his painstakingly thorough work, he was a deputy public defender for nearly 
nine years before going into private practice with the firm of Overland, Berke, 
Wesley, Gits, Randolph &amp; Levanas. He has more than 15 years of criminal 
trial experience. He was court-appointed to the McMartin case at its beginning.
