   More than 4,000 workers at a coal mine in
the southern city of Jastrzebie went on strike today to demand
legalization of Solidarity and higher wages, a spokeswoman said.
   The strike in Jastrzebie, about 275 miles southwest of Warsaw,
comes on the eighth anniversary of the founding of the outlawed
trade federation.
   Solidarity spokeswoman Katarzyna Ketrzynska said workers on the
overnight shift at the Manifest Lipcowy mine stayed outside the
mine shaft all night and were joined by workers arriving for the
morning shift.
   She said security officers blocked miners on the afternoon
shift, which starts at 2 p.m., from entering the grounds to join
the striking miners. The strike began at noon today, according to
Katrzynska.
   She said the miners are demanding the legalization of Solidarity
and reinstatement of workers fired for union activities. The
workers are also calling for higher wages and better working
conditions, and are requesting two lawyers and two economists to
assist them in the negotiations.
   Manifest Lipcowy is the second mine in the industrial region of
Silesia to experience unrest.
   Workers at the Rudna copper mine near the city of Wroclaw staged
a protest rally Monday to demand improved safety conditions and the
return of Solidarity activists to work. Three members of Solidarity
were barred Saturday from working.
   Solidarity was crushed in 1981, when the government imposed
martial law, and was banned nearly a year later by parliament.
   On Aug. 16, 1980, workers at factories around the northern port
of Gdansk joined striking shipyard workers to form Solidarity, the
first and only independent trade federation in the Soviet bloc.
