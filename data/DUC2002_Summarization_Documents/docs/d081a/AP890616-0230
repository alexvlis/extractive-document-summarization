   More than 10,000 coal miners in four
states were off the job today to express sympathy for miners in
Virginia and West Virginia who have waged a bitter strike since
April against the Pittston Coal Group.
   Miners in Pennsylvania and Kentucky today became the third and
fourth states to report walkouts at coal companies. The sympathy
strikes began Monday in West Virginia and spread to Indiana late
Thursday.
   One United Mine Workers representative said today that the
Indiana walkout was prompted by Thursday night's telecast of CBS'
``48 Hours,'' which focused on the Pittston strike, in which 1,600
miners have been off the job since April.
   Pittston dropped out of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association
to negotiate with the union independently, and the two sides have
failed to reach an agreement despite 16 months of negotiations.
   UMW officials gave conflicting indications of whether they are
responsible for the wildcat strike. Some said they are asking union
members to return to work, but Tommy Buchanan, international
executive board member in UMW District 20 in Birmingham, Ala., said
today the final decision on whether 5,000 Alabama miners will join
the strike will be with union President Richard Trumka.
   ``It might be two days. It might be a week. It will start
whenever it comes down from the union president,'' Buchanan said.
   Union spokesman Joe Corcoran was not in his office and has not
returned phone calls this week.
   The head of the coal industry bargaining unit said he had no
plans to confer with the Pittston on the wildcat strikes.
   ``I would no more try to tell someone else how to run their
company than I would expect someone else to try to tell me how to
run my company,'' said Robert H. Quenon, president of Peabody
Holding Co., the nation's largest coal producer, and chairman of the
Bituminous Coal Operators Association.
   Quenon flew to Charleston from St. Louis on Thursday to meet with
reporters and express Peabody's and the association's concerns about
the walkout.
   An estimated 2,300 United Mine Workers members stayed away from
their jobs today in Pennsylvania. Most worked for Rochester &amp;
Pittsburgh Coal Co. operations in central Pennsylvania, where 1,600
miners failed to report for work at midnight Thursday, said company
spokesman Hank Waneck said.
   About 290 miners at Peabody's Camp No. 1 mine in Morganfield,
Ky., didn't report for work today, said company spokesman Tom Clarke.
   At least 270 miners were off the job at two mines in Indiana
today, spokesmen said. Mark Arnold, a spokesman for UMW District 11
in Terre Haute, attributed the action to the CBS show.
   ``When the miners saw that last night, that kind of set them off
to where they decided to walk out,'' he said.
   About one-third of West Virginia's 24,000 miners were reported
off the job today. Some 600 miners in Wise County, Va., who walked
out earlier in the week returned to work this morning.
   The coal companies contend the walkouts at companies other than
Pittston violate a no-strike clause in the 1988 national contract
the union signed with the association. Pittston did not take part in
that agreement.
   Union officials have not returned phone calls this week, but in
the past they have said they have not authorized the walkout.
   ``I think the union leadership ought to exercise its leadership
role and do what they can to lead the miners back to work,'' Quenon
said. ``That's why we have a union. That's why we have an agreement
with the union _ to set out the terms and conditions under which we
will have labor to run our coal mines.
   ``And we expect that to be honored.''
