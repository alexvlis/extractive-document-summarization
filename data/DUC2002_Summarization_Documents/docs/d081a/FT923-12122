WORKERS AT KGHM, Poland's copper producing combine went on strike yesterday
as coal mining unions staged token stoppages in a third of the country's
pits in a major challenge to the government's economic policies.
The strike at KGHM in Lubin, western Poland, where mining unions
representing some 40,0000 workers have been demanding a 30 per cent wage
increase, came despite a management offer at the weekend to increase wages
by 20 per cent. Further increases could only come if the government eased
prohibitive wage control taxes, thus providing a powerful precedent for wage
demands by other groups.
Meanwhile coal mining unions are also demanding wage increases as well as a
clear restructuring strategy for their industry after last week's scattered
stoppages in some 15 of Poland's 71 pits wrung promises of wage rises that
cash strapped managements can ill afford.
In contrast to the copper industry, which continues to show a profit, coal
mining is running at a loss with subsidies stopped in March as the
government moved to control the budget deficit. The industry is experiencing
a coal glut with pit head, power station and export stocks amounting to some
12m tonnes, the equivalent of a month's output.
This has led to temporary lay-offs, which have hit miners' incomes and led
to the present bout of unrest. Polish mines produced 69.7m tonnes of coal in
the first half of the year or 1.5 per cent less than in the same period last
year. Meanwhile KGHM produced 197,000 tonnes of refined copper in the same
period or 3.9 per cent more than in the first half of 1991.
