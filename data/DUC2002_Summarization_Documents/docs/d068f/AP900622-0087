   The Soviet Union said today that a united
Germany can join NATO after a five-year transition period during
which all Soviet and U.S. troops would leave the country. The
United States rejected the proposal, a U.S. official said.
   The proposal was outlined by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze during international talks in East Berlin on the
strategic future of a united Germany.
   The remarks, a copy of which were obtained by The Associated
Press, indicates that a united Germany would be free to join the
Western NATO alliance after a five-year transitional period.
   But in exchange, Western and Soviet troops would pull out of the
country and Germany's own military strength would be sharply
reduced, according to the proposal.
   Shevardnadze made the proposal as he met with U.S. Secretary of
State James A. Baker III and their counterparts from Britain,
France and the two German states.
   ``I am underwhelmed,'' Baker said when asked about the Soviet
proposal while posing for pictures with the other foreign ministers.
   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said U.S.
officials objected to the five-year time limit before Germany could
join NATO. The official said the other Western ministers expressed
the same reservations.
   The United States wants a united Germany to be a member of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Soviet Union has been
staunchly opposed.
   West Germany now is a mainstay of NATO and East Germany is a
member of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   Shevardnadze said the Soviet proposal seeks to limit the
strength of the German armed forces and ``to revamp their structure
to make sure that they are rendered incapable for offensive
operations.''
   It said those reductions could be undertaken over a three-year
period. Germany also would be prevented from producing or deploying
chemmical or nuclear weapons.
   It also said that within six months of unification, all Western
troops should leave West Berlin, which remains technically under
military occupation by the United States, France and Britian.
   The four nations would reduce their military forces in the
country during a three-year period following unification first by
50 percent, then ``bring them down to a level of token contingents,
or completely withdraw them from Germany.''
   There are about 380,000 Soviet troops in East Germany, while a
quarter-million U.S. troops are stationed in West Germany along
with tens of thousands of British and French soldiers.
   Previously, the Soviets had said their troops would stay in what
is now East Germany for several years, but had left unclear the
exact plans for pulling them out.
   Shevardnadze, speaking earlier at a ceremony for the removal of
the Western Allies' Checkpoint Charlie, said he wanted the Big Four
Powers' troops out of ``greater Berlin'' within six months after
unification.
   The proposal, as translated into English by the Soviets and
distributed to the news media, apparently would also include the
Kremlin's soldiers stationed just outside the city proper.
   The United States, France and Great Britain have an estimated
12,000 troops in West Berlin. An official reached by telephone in
the office of the military attache at the Soviet embassy in East
Berlin said there were no Soviet troops stationed in the city
proper.
