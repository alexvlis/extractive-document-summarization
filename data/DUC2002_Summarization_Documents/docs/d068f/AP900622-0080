   Soldiers from three nations locked the doors
of Checkpoint Charlie today and a crane whisked away the Cold War
relic that symbolized a divided world.
   A U.S. Army band played a stirring song about old Berlin as the
rectangular white sentry station, a place East Germans died trying
to reach, was hoisted onto a truck for its passage into history.
   The famed Allied checkpoint by the Berlin Wall was closed with
an elaborate ceremony that brought together the top diplomats from
the Germanys and the four World War II Allies.
   ``For 29 years Checkpoint Charlie embodied the Cold War,'' U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III told a crowd of invited
guests and journalists on Berlin's Friedrich Street.
   ``And now, 29 years after it was built, we meet here today to
dismantle it and to bury the conflicts it created.''
   Baker, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and the
foreign ministers from France, Britain and the two Germanys each
heralded the end of the checkpoint as a symbol of change.
   Shevardnadze called for the removal of Berlin's status as an
Allied-controlled city and the withdrawal of troops within six
months after the two German states unify, which could come in
December.
   The proposal, as translated into English by the Soviets and
distributed later to news media, apparently would also include the
Kremlin's soldiers stationed just outside the city proper. The
United States, France and Great Britain have an estimated 12,000
troops in West Berlin.
   Berlin has been split into Soviet, U.S., British and France
sectors and West Berlin remains technically separate from West
Germany.
   The German and Allied foreign ministers are meeting in East
Berlin to discuss the status of the city and a united Germany's
role in world affairs.
   All borders are to be opened between the Berlins and the
Germanys by July 2, when the nations merge their economies.
   Large sections of the Berlin Wall are being dismantled daily,
and U.S. officials decided to time the removal of Checkpoint
Charlie with the foreign ministers' meeting.
   A color guard of French, British and American soldiers strode to
the building and locked the doors leading to each Allied nation's
compartment in the checkpoint.
   The giant crane then lifted the box-like building high into the
air. U.S. Army spokesman Sgt. Ed McCarthy said he believes it is
destined for a museum.
   Checkpoint Charlie stood just 20 yards from an East German
checkpoint and was the only place between the Berlins that could be
crossed on foot by non-Germans.
   The ceremony was closed to the public but not to the residents
of the buildings that line Friedrich Street, which had been divided
by the Berlin Wall since 1961.
   Illa Wobig leaned out her window and watched the ceremony unfold
just 20 yards below the fourth-floor apartment where she has lived
for 24 years.
   ``I saw eight people shot to death on that street,'' she said.
``I saw an East German officer try to go under a guard rail. He was
shot in the neck.''
   She said she also saw at least 20 successful escapes, by tunnel,
car and on foot.
   ``I saw Kennedy, Reagan and Carter give speeches here,'' she
said. ``I saw a James Bond movie filmed here. This is wonderful for
history but it is sad for me. It was part of my home.''
   East German construction worker Andreas Bratke was working near
the wall in January 1986 when he suddenly bolted through the East
German checkpoint, down Friedrich Street and through Checkpoint
Charlie.
   ``I ran as fast as I could,'' he said from his home in West
Berlin. ``Checkpoint Charlie is a very important place to me.''
