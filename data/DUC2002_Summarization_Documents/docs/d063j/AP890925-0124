<HEAD>Prime Minister Condemns IRA for Music School Explosion</HEAD>

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said
Monday the Irish Republican Army members who blew up the Royal
Marines School of Music and killed 10 bandsmen last week are
``monsters'' who will be found and punished.
   ``The young men whom we lost were murdered by common murderers
who must be found and brought to justice and put behind bars for a
very long time,'' she said following a tour of the school's wrecked
barracks in Deal, southeast England.
   ``We lost 10 remarkable musicians, not fighting men, just
because some people try to bomb others out of their democratic
views,'' she said. ``They are very evil people, absolute monsters.''
   Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the legal political arm of
the IRA, issued a statement disputing Mrs. Thatcher's remarks,
saying ``she knows in her heart of hearts the real nature of the
conflict, its cause and the remedy.''
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the predominantly Protestant province with the Roman Catholic
Republic of Ireland.
   ``We want an end to all violent deaths arising out of the
present relationship between our two countries,'' Adams said. ``We
want a new peaceful relationship based on an acceptance and respect
for our rights as a sovereign nation.''
   After visiting some of the 11 injured bandsmen still in the
hospital, Mrs. Thatcher pledged: ``The hunt for the bombers will be
pursued with all possible speed, vigor and dedication.''
   Raymond Kendall, the secretary-general of the international
police organization Interpol, pledged the organization's full
support in the hunt for those who blew up the school.
   ``I hope we will have a part to play in finding them,'' said
Kendall after opening the International Police Exhibition and
Conference in London.
   ``They are criminals of the worst sort and should be dealt with
as such.''
   Before landing in Deal, Mrs. Thatcher's helicopter flew over the
rubble that had been the band's recreation center.
   The IRA claimed responsibility for the explosion, and police
said they are looking for three men with Irish accents who rented a
house overlooking the barracks.
