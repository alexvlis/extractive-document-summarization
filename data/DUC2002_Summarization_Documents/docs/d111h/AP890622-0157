   A deep-sea inspection of the Bismarck suggests
that the most powerful battleship in Adolf Hitler's navy was
scuttled by its own crew rather than sunk by the British in a
celebrated battle, underwater explorer Robert D. Ballard said
Thursday.
   During a 90-minute news conference, Ballard described how he his
ocean-crawling robot located the Bismarck ``sitting upright and
proud'' two weeks ago.
   Then the American oceanographer, whose father was of British
background and whose mother was of German heritage, addressed
himself to the German people in German.
   ``I am an underwater explorer, not a treasure hunter,'' he said,
translating himself back into English. ``We found no human remains.
We touched nothing and took nothing. ... The future of the Bismarck
is in the hands of the German people.''
   He said he will disclose its exact location only to Germany so
Germans themselves can decide whether to try to raise the ship,
which sank after a battle May 27, 1941.
   Ballard, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts, said structural evidence satisfied him
that the Germans scuttled the battleship rather than trying to
surrender or allowing her to be sent down by British fire.
   ``Only scuttled ships tend to make it to the bottom in one
piece,'' Ballard said. ``It appears the crew opened it up along its
entire length. It was clearly flooded, stem to stern.''
   ``Maybe the Germans didn't want it taken as a war prize,'' he
added.
   It is known that two years earlier, Hitler ordered the German
pocket battleship Graf Spee scuttled after it was cornered in the
neutral port of Montevideo, Uruguay, and attacked by British ships.
Hitler apparently wanted to keep the British from learning the
secrets of the Graf Spee's construction and weapons.
   In the 1941 battle, the Bismarck's main guns were quickly knocked
out and the attacking British ships were out of range of her
secondary guns, Ballard said, so its was helpless and taking
hundreds of hits _ its sinking clearly inevitable.
   Rendered unsteerable by torpedoes dropped by tiny fabric-covered
British biplanes, it was unable to escape.
   Asked if the German commander couldn't have surrendered by
ceasing fire, Ballard said ``in the fuzz of battle'' in fierce seas
it would have been unlikely that the British would have recognized
that the Germans were giving up.
   Again, he speculated, perhaps the Germans did not want the ship's
technologically advanced equipment to fall into British hands.
   The Bismarck was found by Ballard in more than 15,000 feet of
water about 600 miles west of Brest, France. He said it was in
remarkably good shape, ``elegant, well preserved.''
   Before the battle, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill had
left convoys unprotected and thrown all his capital ships in pursuit
with a ringing three-word command: ``Sink the Bismarck!''
   Of the Bismarck's 2,200-man crew, only about 115 survived.
British ships picked up 110 survivors but left with hundreds of
German sailors still in the icy waters after spotting what might
have been a German U-boat. German vessels later rescued only five
more survivors.
   The story has been recounted in books, songs and a movie.
   The sinking occurred only eight days after the Bismarck left
Gdynia, Poland, for her first operation. If unstopped, it could have
posed a critical threat to convoys of merchant shipping and undercut
British morale at a time when England stood virtually alone against
combined German sea and air power.
   The British sent the warship Hood after the Bismarck but within
five days of going to sea the Bismarck had sunk the Hood in a
three-minute engagement, with the loss of all but three of the
vessel's crew of 1,419.
   The Hood was a symbol of British sea power, and its loss stunned
the British public and the war government and made sinking the
Bismarck a mission of crucial importance.
   Ballard said under laws of the sea, the Bismarck remains the
property of the German people.
   The sunken battleship was discovered and photographed by the same
remote-controlled robot that Ballard used four years ago to find the
wreck of the Titanic, the British passenger liner that sank in 1912
after striking an iceberg.
