<HEAD>Parliamentary President Resigns Under Pressure</HEAD>

   Leopold Gratz, the president of Parliament
and one of the most powerful politicians in the Socialist Party,
resigned today over a scandal surrounding the mysterious sinking of
ship 12 years ago.
   Gratz, 59, is the second senior Socialist official to step down
because of his alleged involvement in the so-called ``Lucona''
scandal, the subject of a widely publicized investigation by a
parliamentary committee.
   Interior Minister Karl Blecha, like Gratz a onetime protege of
former Chancellor Bruno Kreisky, resigned Jan.19.
   Blecha and Gratz have denied wrongdoing or aiding Udo Proksch,
the prime suspect in the sinking of the ship Lucona in the Indian
Ocean. Six sailors died.
   The Lucona's cargo was officially described by Proksch as for a
uranium processing plant and insured for $16 million.
   The insurance company has never paid, claiming the cargo was only
scrap metal and alleging the vessel was intentionally sunk to
collect the insurance money.
   Proksch, wanted by Austrian justice on suspicion of murder and
insurance fraud, has been variously described to be living in Syria,
the Philippines and Latin America.
   In several interviews, Gratz described himself as a close friend
of Proksch, but when Proksch fled to escape prosecution, Gratz
criticized him.
   Gratz told Parliament today he would give up his seat in
February, hence his post as president, one of the most prestigious
posts in Austria.
   ``My decision is a personal one and it is politically
motivated,'' Gratz told the house.
   ``If it becomes impossible for the president to effectively take
a stand on significant issues or to speak up on problems of
parliamentarism because everybody is only interested in his context
in a single other topic, then he cannot serve the National Council
(parliament) in such a way as is his duty.'' In past newspaper
stories, Gratz was accused of providing fabricated evidence from
abroad to help Proksch in his claim that the controversial shipment
was for a uranium processing plant.
   Gratz, who denied the allegations, was also accused of helping
Proksch in several other ways. Like Blecha, Gratz is to appear
before the parliamentary investigation committee.
