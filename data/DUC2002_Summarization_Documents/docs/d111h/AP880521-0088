   Greek divers have plunged 162 feet beneath
the Aegean Sea and back into history, finding a treasure-laden
Turkish warship sunk by Greek revolutionaries in 1822.
   The remains of the wooden sailing ship were found near the
island of Chios in the eastern Aegean at a point where historical
accounts place the sinking of the Ottoman ship, according to Peter
Nicolaides, a diver and salvage expert.
   The Bourloti Seimaz _ or ``Explosives Invincible'' _ was set
afire and sunk by Greek Admiral Constantine Kanaris in revenge for
Turkish killing and looting on Chios.
   Thousands of islanders died in the Turkish raids, which shocked
other nations and swung Western European countries behind the Greek
struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire. Greece won
independence in 1830.
   The French painter Eugene Delacroix produced a famous picture,
``The Massacre of Chios,'' based on the raids.
   ``It's an incredible discovery, straight out of the history book
we used to read in school about the War of Independence,''
Nicolaides said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press.
   Nicolaides, who heard about the wreck while teaching an
underwater archaeology course to local divers last winter, started
querying fishermen about where their nets snagged on seabed
obstacles.
   He pinpointed the wreck on May 3, he said.
   ``When I dived, I found ships' timbers sticking out of the muddy
seabed and dozens of objects _ Islamic cooking pots, cannon balls,
a candlestick, even a chalice from a Greek Orthodox church,'' he
said.
   ``The ship was obviously crammed with loot from Chios. I think
there may be gold and silver items as well,'' he said. ``I also saw
what I recognized as human bones,'' he added.
   He said the wreckage indicated the vessel was at least 100 feet
in length.
   According to historians, more than 1,000 people _ including 400
Greek captives _ were aboard the ship when Kanaris staged his
attack in the early hours of June 7, 1822.
   The Greek admiral sailed from the nearby island of Psara, towing
a boat stuffed with explosives. Its pointed bow was rammed into the
mouth of a cannon on the Bourloti Seimaz and a fuse lit.
   The Ottoman commander, Admiral Kara Ali, was killed in the blast
that split the ship. Kanaris and his crew of Greeks escaped.
   ``This is a very significant, very emotive find, coming from
this particular period of history,'' said George
Papathanassopoulos, the Culture Ministry's adviser on marine
archaeology.
   Papathanassopoulos said the 162-foot water depth at the site
will make investigation difficult since underwater archaeology
rarely is attempted at depths over 113 feet, but he said, ``This is
a ship that must be explored.''
   Nicolaides said he hoped it would be possible to tap American
and Turkish expertise to excavate the wreck as an international
project.
   American experts from the Institute of Nautical Archaeology at
Texas A &amp; M University, working in cooperation with Turkish divers,
have pioneered underwater excavation off the Turkish Aegean coast.
   Greek marine archaeologists focus on locating and surveying
historic wrecks scattered around the Aegean and rarely carry out
excavations.
