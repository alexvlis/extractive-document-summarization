  [Text] Buenos Aires, 23 May (NA) -- Today, the Foreign 
Ministry said that control operations carried out by the 
corvette Spiro against a Korean-flagged [as received] ship 
fishing illegally in Argentine waters were carried out "in 
accordance with international law and in coordination with the 
Foreign Ministry." 
  The Foreign Ministry thus approved the intervention by the 
Argentine corvette when it discovered the Korean ship Chin Yuan 
Hsing violating Argentine jurisdictional waters on 21 May. 
  The Argentine Navy reported today that the corvette Spiro 
stayed near the Korean ship "given the adverse weather 
conditions, and fulfilling its responsibilities of sea search 
and rescue." 
  The Korean ship, which had been fishing illegally in 
Argentine waters, was sunk by its own crew after failing to 
answer to the Argentine ship's warnings. 
  The crew was transferred to the Chin Chuan Hsing, which was 
sailing nearby and approached to rescue the crew of the sinking 
ship. 
  The Navy reported that around 15 nautical miles off the 
coast 
of Malvinas and "in accordance with bilateral agreements with 
Great Britain, the Spiro transferred assistance responsibility 
to British authorities." 
  The Foreign Ministry said "an understanding with the UK for 
operations in cases of uninterrupted persecution of illegally 
fishing ships was implemented." 
  The Foreign Ministry also said the policy "is in accordance 
with the growing international opinion currently giving priority 
to the preservation, regulation, and the sustainable use of 
marine live resources and the effective punishment of violators 
of national laws on the matter."
