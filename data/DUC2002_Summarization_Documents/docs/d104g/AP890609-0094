   More than 5,000 people chanting ``Freedom will
survive!'' packed a Chinatown park this morning in a memorial
service for students slain by soldiers in Tiananmen Square. They
then marched through the streets in a funeral procession.
   ``The gods are crying for what's happening in China today. It's a
great tragedy,'' said Harry Zinn of International Ladies Garment
Workers Union Local 2325, addressing the crowd through a steady
rain. ``Our hearts go out to the people of China.''
   The crowd, which stood respectfully and silently during a
traditional funeral ceremony, waved banners and wore buttons
honoring ``the martyrs of Tiananmen Square'' and calling for
democracy in China.
   After the service and several speeches, the crowd marched through
the streets of Chinatown, led by a casket and a traditional Chinese
funeral bier containing fruit and incense. As they headed up
Mulberry Street, a major street in Chinatown, they walked beneath a
30-foot black banner strung across the road.
   ``This has united the Chinese people for one cause _ to overthrow
the government and establish democracy,'' said Peter Lee, one of the
student organizers of the service. ``We must never allow them to
crush another body.''
   The funeral procession stretched for blocks through Chinatown,
tying up traffic. Demonstrators planned another rally later in the
day outside the United Nations.
