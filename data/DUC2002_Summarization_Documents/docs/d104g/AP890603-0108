   Here is a look at key events in the student
pro-democracy movement that led to Sunday's assault by soldiers on
protesters in Tiananmen Square:
   April 15 _ Former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang dies. Beijing
University students put up posters praising him and indirectly
criticizing opponents who forced his resignation after student
demonstrations in 1986-87.
   April 17 _ Thousands of students march in Beijing and Shanghai,
shouting ``Long live Hu Yaobang! Long live democracy!''
   April 27 _ More than 150,000 students, with wide support from
people on the street, surge past police lines and fill Tiananmen
Square, chanting slogans for democracy and freedom.
   April 29 _ Officials meet with student leaders, but independent
student groups are not satisfied and continue a class boycott at 41
universities.
   April 30 _ Beijing's Communist Party chief, Zhao Ziyang, meets
with student representatives.
   May 4 _ About 100,000 students and supporters march on Tiananmen
Square to celebrate the 70th anniversary of China's first student
movement. Demonstrations are held in Shanghai, Nanjing and other
cities. About 300 journalists protest outside the official Xinhua
News Agency.
   May 9 _ Journalists petition the government for press freedom.
   May 10 _ Thousands of students bicycle to major media offices in
a press freedom demonstration. Another protest is held in the
provincial capital of Taiyuan.
   May 13 _ About 2,000 students begin a hunger strike in Tiananmen
Square.
   May 14 _ Thousands flock to the square to back the students. The
number fasting rises to 3,000.
   May 15 _ The government deadline for students to leave the
square passes. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's welcoming
ceremony planned near the square must be moved to the airport.
   May 16 _ Hundreds of thousands occupy the square. Journalists
and intellectuals join the protest.
   May 17 _ Zhao pleas for students to leave. Students reject his
appeal and hold marches that generate 1 million supporters in
Beijing.
   May 18 _ About 1 million people, including many workers, again
take to the streets to show their support for the hunger strikers.
Li Peng issues a stern lecture to student leaders and refuses to
discuss their demands.
   May 19 _ A tearful Zhao visits weakened hunger strikers. Li also
visits the students briefly. The students later decide to end the
hunger strike.
   May 20 _ Martial law is declared in parts of Beijing. Zhao
reportedly resigns after failing to persuade Li and other
hardliners to compromise. Students resume their hunger strike, then
abandon it, saying they will need their strength for the struggle
ahead.
   May 21 _ Students claim to reject an order by Li Peng to leave
the Tiananman Square or face military action. Defying martial law,
hundreds of thousands of people remain in the square or block
intersections to prevent troops from reaching it.
   May 22 _ Hundreds of thousands of people again block major roads
and senior military leaders say they are resisting orders to order
their troops on the protesters. At least one military convoy is
reported to withdraw.
   May 23 _ One million people take to the streets to demonstrate
for democracy.
   May 25 _ Li makes his first appearance since declaring martial
law. State- run radio says 27 of 29 provinces support martial law,
and military units announce they support martial law.
   May 26 _ Sources say Zhao and another leading liberal, Wan Li,
head of the legislature, are under house arrest.
   May 27 _ Beijing student leaders propose students end their
occupation of Tiananmen Square. Non-Beijing students resist and the
sit-in continues.
   May 28 _ About 80,000 people, many students from outside the
capital, stage a demonstration, but unlike in past rallies few
workers participate.
   May 30 _ Students unveil their ``Goddess of Democracy,'' a
replica of the Statue of Liberty, on the square. The government
calls it an insult to the nation. Students rally outside police
headquarters to protest the detention of three members of an
independent labor union.
   May 31 _ The first of several pro-government rallies is staged
by farmers and workers in Beijing suburbs. The participants,
ordered to show up, show little enthusiasm.
   June 1 _ The Beijing Municipal Government warns foreign
journalists that under martial law they must receive approval for
all press coverage. Coverage of the demonstrations is banned.
   June 2 _ More than 1,000 troops appear outside the railway
station in a show of force.
   June 3-4 _ Tens of thousands of troops make several attempts to
move on the square but are driven back by crowds of hundreds of
thousands of people supporting the students. Riot squads beat and
fire tear gas at demonstrators. A final push is made the evening of
June 3, and soldiers begin firing on crowds. Troops surround and
enter the square June 4 in the early morning hours and thousands of
protesters flee. Hundreds are wounded and many dead.
