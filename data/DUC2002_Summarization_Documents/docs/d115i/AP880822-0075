   Rescuers searched through debris today
for victims of an earthquake that ravaged one-third of this
country's territory and parts of India, killing at least 650 people
and injuring thousands.
   The death toll was expected to climb from Sunday's pre-dawn
quake on the India-Nepal border, which triggered landslides and
floods and was the mountainous region's deadliest in 38 years.
   Officials in both countries said they had yet to receive reports
from the remote Himalayan areas hardest hit by the temblor, which
knocked out power and communications and was said to injure at
least 3,000 people.
   Niranjan Thapa, Nepal's minister of state for home affairs, told
a news conference at least 450 were dead and up to 1,000 injured.
He said officials expected the numbers to climb.
   Indian officials reported at least 200 people dead and more than
2,000 injured, most by debris from collapsing buildings.
   The quake, centered almost on the India-Nepal border, registered
6.5 on the Richter scale.
   Indian television today showed the devastation in the Indian
state of Bihar: crumbled buildings, makeshift morgues lined with
rows of bodies wrapped in white shrouds, damaged hospital wards
packed with survivors.
   Medical teams in India carried medicine and other supplies to
overcrowded hospitals and the army was deployed to help search for
victims.
   But the monsoons, which hit the subcontinent in late June and
usually last through September, hampered relief operations.
   Nepal's Thapa told a news conference that ``the rains have been
a great hindrance in carrying out rescue works. Access to some
areas of this mountain country is impossible.''
   He said 21 of the kingdom's 75 districts suffered extensive
damage. The hardest hit appeared to be Dharan, a sparsely populated
border region where Thapa said at least 131 people died.
   Bir Bahadur Shahi, secretary of the home affairs ministry, flew
to eastern Nepal on Sunday. He said 50,000 to 60,000 houses were
destroyed in the Dharan district alone.
   ``Ninety percent of the remaining houses are cracked,'' Shahi
said, adding that most of the damage was to modern houses of stone
and older houses from mud and bricks. Wooden houses were not
affected, he said.
   Many people were given shelter in schools, guesthouses and
public buildings, ``but most of the people do not want to leave
their homes,'' Shahi said. He said water supplies were still
adequate and there were no reports of disease breaking out.
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi flew to Bihar to tour some of the
hardest hit areas. The government said it would release a detailed
report after he returned to the capital tonight.
   Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha of Nepal visited some
of the victims at Bir Hospital in his capital, Katmandu.
   The quake roused people from their sleep in Bihar and nine other
Indian states and central and eastern Nepal. It lasted about a
minute and aftershocks continued for about an hour.
   Rail tracks sank into the soggy ground and bridges over rising
rivers cracked, paralyzing train service and road travel in many
parts of the devastated areas.
   Parts of northern Bangladesh and the capital, Dhaka, also felt
the tremor. There were reports that 50 people were injured, most by
jumping from their houses during the quake.
   Witnesses in Darbhanga, an Indian city of 800,000 about 45 miles
south of the epicenter, said the only warnings were hissing sounds,
rattling doors and cracking windows. Women began blowing conch
shells, following an ancient tradition believed to appease the
weather gods.
   More than 25,000 houses were flattened in Darbhanga, as well as
the districts of Munger and Madhubani, Indian officials said.
   In Madhubani, the Bhootahi Balan River jumped its banks and
flooded nearly 50 villages. Officials said at least 45 people died,
but it was not known whether the deaths were due to floods or
collapsing houses.
   It was the worst quake to strike the region in 38 years. A
temblor rumbled through the Indian state of Assam on the
India-China border in August 1950. Official accounts said more than
1,500 people died, but seismologists said their records showed
30,000 were killed.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
Every increase of one number means the ground motion is 10 times
greater. A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in
populated areas.
