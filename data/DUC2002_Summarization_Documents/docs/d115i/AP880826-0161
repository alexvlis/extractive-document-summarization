   An earthquake that devastated parts of
Nepal and India earlier this week has killed more than 980 people,
officials from the two countries said Friday.
   Mourners paraded through the streets of this medieval town,
calling for revenge after a former legislator was beaten to death
by political rivals while he was distributing relief supplies to
earthquake victims.
   ``Hang the murderers,'' scores of young men chanted as they
marched in front of a jeep bearing the battered body of Karna
Hyanju, once a sympathizer of the now-outlawed Communist Party.
   Witnesses said Hyanju was beaten with umbrellas and sticks late
Thursday afternoon, then dragged through the streets for nearly two
hours before police intervened. He died Friday at the Bir hospital
in Katmandu, 7 miles west of Bhaktapur.
   Uttam Dhaubanjar, a 28-year-old bank employee and neighbor of
the dead man, said Hyanju had been handing out blankets, milk and
other food in Bhaktapur when he was accosted by a group of men who
accused him of giving relief supplies only to his own supporters.
   Reports of damage and devastation continued to arrive from
remote parts of Nepal on Friday, and the Home Affairs Ministry
updated its confirmed death toll to 704.
   In India, the official count rose to 277. But survivors, the
news media and opposition politicians say the toll could be as high
as 1,500.
   Sunday's earthquake registered 6.5 on the Richter scale, which
records energy released by a tremor according to ground motion
measured by a seismograph. A reading of 6 indicates the possibility
of severe damage, while 7 signifies a major quake.
   Dhaubanjar said he saw about 40 people rounded up by police
Thursday night after Hyanju's beating death. He said many belonged
to the same Communist faction that Hyanju once supported.
   ``People started beating him with umbrellas,'' Dhaubanjar said.
``There were a lot of scratches on his body, and a lot of blood. It
looked like one ear was missing. Then they made a necklace of their
shoes (by tying the laces together), put it around his neck and
pulled him through the streets.''
   As Hyanju's body was taken through the winding streets of
Bhaktapur, a 12th-century town of ancient Hindu temples, thousands
of the town's 50,000 people jammed streets, temple steps and the
balconies of brick and mud houses.
   Pashupati Rana, one of several Cabinet ministers who marched in
the funeral procession, said several people were arrested in the
killing, including the mayor, the deputy mayor and a member of the
Rashtriya Panchayat, or non-partisan assembly.
   Rana, who is minister of local development and legislative,
affairs, called Hyanju's death ``political murder.''
   Hyanju served in the Panchayat from 1981 until 1986 when he lost
the backing of the Communists in Bhaktapur, traditionally a leftist
stronghold.
   The Panchayat, whose members are elected on non-party lines, was
created after the late king Mahendra abolished the old Parliament
and all political parties in 1960, saying a Western-style
parliamentary system was not suited to his mountain kingdom.
   Dhaubanjar and a group of young men who gathered around him said
Hyanju was perceived as a government supporter despite his previous
communist leanings.
