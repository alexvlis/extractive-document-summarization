   Retired Sen. John Tower, the defense
secretary-designate, underwent surgery Thursday to remove a colon
polyp, a hospital spokesman said.
   ``Senator Tower is resting comfortably and is listed in fair
condition,'' hospital spokesman Steve Habgood said Thursday night.
``The senator is expected to make a full recovery.''
   Tower, 63, a U.S. senator from Texas for 24 years, was admitted
to Baylor University Medical Center on Wednesday after undergoing a
colonscopy examination last week that revealed the polyp, Habgood
said.
   A preliminary biopsy of the polyp showed it was benign, Habgood
said, but further results would be announced Friday by Tower's
surgeon, Dr. R.D. Dignan, of Dallas.
   Thursday's surgery took approximately three hours, Habgood said.
   When Tower underwent the colonscopy examination, a rectal polyp
also was discovered and removed. Tests of that growth showed it to
contain some ``malignant but well differentiated cells,'' Habgood
said.
   Further explanation of the first polyp removal would have to come
from Tower's surgeon, who was unavailable for comment Thursday
night, the spokesman said.
   After leaving the Senate in 1985, Tower went into business as a
defense consultant. He also served as an arms negotiator for
President Reagan and he headed the White House's Iran-Contra
investigative panel.
   President-elect Bush designated Tower as his defense secretary on
Dec. 16. The nomination is subject to Senate approval.
