   John G. Tower has fallen, but the sky has not.
   For all the forecasts of dire results if the Senate blocked
Tower's path to the Pentagon, business is proceeding as usual.
President Bush said the case was closed and accepted Democratic
assurances of future cooperation.
   That doesn't undo the resentment among some of Tower's more
ardent Republican allies in the Senate and in some corners of the
White House. Bush lieutenants claimed they had heard what sounded
like assurances of support from a dozen Senate Democrats. They ended
up with only three Democrats in the close-to-party-line vote against
Tower.
   Nevertheless, a week after the former Texas senator was denied
confirmation as secretary of defens, the waters have closed.
   There will be ripples, and some of them could be wave-sized. The
good-behavior rules set in the debate over Tower's drinking habits
and his lucrative defense consulting business are certain to be
invoked as precedents whenever Republicans spot a Democratic target.
   ``We've established what will be known as the Tower standards,''
said Sen. John Warner, R-Va.
   That argument will be used by House Republicans challenging the
financial conduct of House Speaker Jim Wright. But it will be a
debating point, not a turning point, in a Wright controversy that
was ordained long before the Tower episode.
   While President Bush was unwavering in his support of Tower, he
burned no bridges to congressional Democrats. He insisted that Tower
was the best man for the job and he spoke out repeatedly for his
choice, even after it was clear that the nomination was doomed. But
he didn't get nasty about it, saying there was no point in
escalating the fight.
   ``That's over,'' he said 24 hours after the Tower defeat.
``That's history. And now we are going to go forward.''
   The 53-47 vote against Tower was a setback to Bush in the sense
that it always is a defeat when Congress denies a president
something he wants. But this denial did not cost Bush a program, or
a major campaign pledge, or the support of voters.
   Indeed, it could turn out that the Senate did the president a
favor by sending Tower back to Texas instead of to the Pentagon. It
was a break Bush could not make with a political ally who had been
after the Pentagon job since Ronald Reagan was elected president.
   Tower had not been a Reagan man _ he had supported Bush for the
1980 nomination. And the Reagan White House went to some lengths to
rule the senator out of the job he sought, declaring that the new
president would not be nominating any Senate Republican for any
Cabinet post.
   After Tower's long wait, Bush displayed his own loyalty, all the
way to a losing vote when the standard, somewhat safer course would
have been to withdraw the nominee. Tower not only shunned
withdrawal; he offered conditions that had to be humiliating, if
only the Senate would let him have the job.
   Tower promised to quit drinking, taking the pledge on national
television. And when that didn't work, he offered to become the
first-ever probationary Cabinet member. Republicans proposed that he
get the job for a six-month trial and then return for
reconfirmation, a gimmick that would have changed the system and
could have haunted the presidency.
   No deal. So Tower became the ninth Cabinet nominee ever to be
rejected, the first who was a former senator.
   Bush said he had been fighting for the right of a president to
appoint his own Cabinet, but he avoided language that would have
raised the political stakes.
   Tower did not restrain himself. Battling for the job, he said
withdrawal would damage Bush and rejection would be ``damning the
president's judgment.'' He said his nomination had been turned into
a vehicle for a major presidential defeat.
   Tower's advocates on the Senate floor said grave constitutional
issues were at stake, that the authority of the presidency was on
the line, that the Senate will come to rue the rules it wrote in the
Tower decision.
   But Bush said all along that the outcome, either way, would not
hurt on other issues.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Armed Services Committee and the
pivotal figure in the Tower defeat, agreed. He told his Georgia
constituents that the Tower rejection would not hurt Bush's
leadership.
   ``In Washington, `triumphs' and `setbacks' are short-lived,''
Nunn said, ``and that's particularly true of the president.''
