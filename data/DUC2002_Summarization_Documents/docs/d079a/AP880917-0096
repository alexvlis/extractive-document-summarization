   Rains from Hurricane Gilbert sent a
river raging over its banks in Monterrey, sweeping at least 10
policemen to their deaths and overturning buses loaded with
evacuees from Matamoros, police said today.
   The flooding occurred in Monterrey, an industrial city of 3
million people, located 110 miles from the Texas border and 140
miles inland from Matamoros.
   At least 10 police officers were swept away while on a rescue
mission around midnight, a judicial police officer said. Several
buses loaded with evacuees overturned in the raging water and more
were feared drowned.
   The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said early
today it had been raining for more than 24 hours.
   A trailer truck also slid into the Santa Catarina river in the
driving rain and its two occupants were missing, the local
newspaper El Norte said.
   Recreational areas with soccer fields, basketball courts, tennis
courts and jogging trails have been built along the river in the
last few years.
   Monterrey is a major northern industrial center and the capital
of Nuevo Leon state. The Santa Catarina river crosses Monterrey.
   The storm slammed into Mexico for the second time in a week
Friday afternoon. The eye of 450-mile-wide hurricane, with 120 mph
winds, crossed onto land at 5:35 p.m. EDT, sweeping ashore in a
sparsely populated area 120 miles south of Brownsville, Texas,
weather reports said.
   Although the storm had lost much of its muscle, it caused floods
and mudslides after it barreled into Mexico. Earlier in the week,
Gilbert killed at least 29 and left 300,000 people homeless in the
Yucatan Peninsula.
   The hurricane has killed at least 109 people, including one in
Texas, 39 in Mexico, 26 in Jamaica, 30 in Haiti, five in the
Dominican Republic and eight in Honduras. However, the death toll
is expected to rise.
   In Matamoros just across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, the
storm felled trees, downed power lines and flattened dozens of tin
shack homes on the evacuated beachfront. About 5,000 people were
evacuated inland.
   Nearly two dozen tornadoes were reported around Brownsville.
Much of the Yucatan Peninsula remained without communications and
supplies today.
   At 9 a.m. EDT today, Gilbert's center was located near latitude
25.1 north and longitude 100.3 west, or 185 miles west southwest of
Brownsville and 40 miles south of Monterrey, said the National
Hurricane Center in Florida.
   Maximum sustained winds were estimated to be near 50 mph and the
storm was expected to weaken further during the next 24 hours.
   The center said rainfall of 10 to 15 inches was accompanying the
storm with up to 20 inches locally. Flash floods were likely, it
said.
   The storm was moving west-northwest at about 12 mph, and was
expected to follow that track through midday today before turning
gradually to the northwest, forecasters said.
   In Matamoros, officials said the worst part of the storm
appeared to have passed. ``Up to now the damages are not considered
very grave,'' said Jose Inez Gonzalez, a Matamoros government
spokesman.
   Officials distributed crackers and water to thousands of people
in shelters and rged them to stay put until the storm ended.
   Gilbert hit Soto la Marina, a town of 8,000 people 20 miles
inland from La Pesca on late Friday, its mayor told The Associated
Press by telephone.
   ``There is considerable material damage to the town. It is still
raining very hard,'' said Mayor Ruben Hinojosa Cortina. ``We will
just have to stay in and wait until tomorrow to survey the
situation.''
   Hinojosa Cortina said about 3,000 refugees from La Pesca were
sheltered in Soto la Marina but other coastal residents had not
been evacuated or decided to ride out the storm.
   The Sierra de Tamaulipas, a small mountain range between
Monterrey and the coast, should blunt the hurricane's strength,
said Mark Zimmer, a meterologist at the National Hurricane Center.
   Zimmer expected the last of hurricane-force winds today. But he
predicted very heavy rains as warm hurricane winds rise into cooler
mountain air, possibly causing flash floods and mudslides.
   The Mexican armed forces began emergency flights Friday of food,
medicines and water to Cancun, Cozumel and other disaster sites in
the Yucatan.
   In many locations, hurricane victims were without food, drinking
water, electrical power, gasoline and communications since
Wednesday.
