<F P=106> [Colin Brown article: "Cabinet Allies Close Ranks But Bring </F>
Scant Relief to Major"] 
  [Text] Cabinet ministers rallied behind John Major 
yesterday by insisting there would be no leadership election 
this autumn. But the concerted show of support failed to dispel 
doubts among Tory MPs about his chances of staying in office. 
  Right-wing MPs confirmed the findings in an INDEPENDENT ON 
SUNDAY/NOP [National Opinion Poll] poll that Michael Heseltine 
was the favourite to replace Mr Major, if he is forced out. But 
they are calculating that Michael Portillo will run hard to 
secure Eurosceptic policies from the eventual winner. 
  Some of Mr Major's closest allies were seething with anger 
at 
Mr Heseltine and Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor, for "posturing" 
before the damaging retreat last week by the Prime Minister over 
Britain's veto powers in the enlarged European Union. "Why were 
Clarke and Heseltine trying to sound more Portilloesque than 
Portillo? The answer's pretty obvious," said one Cabinet 
minister. 
  The leadership is hoping that over the Easter recess the 
Conservative constituencies will urge their MPs to stop the 
damaging in-fighting which they believe is overshadowing the 
Government's fightback on the economy, law and order and 
education. 
  That message was reinforced by three Cabinet ministers who 
broke their Easter Sundays to support Mr Major. John Patten, 
the Secretary of State for Education, said: "He is a man of very 
great resilience. It must be tough for him. No one likes the 
level of criticism he has been getting. But he will be carrying 
on a 20- to 30-year programme begun in 1979 through to the next 
general election." 
  Michael Howard, the Home Secretary, said: "There is no 
prospect of any leadership contest. John Major is going to lead 
the Conservative Party successfully into the next general 
election." He dismissed one poll of 100 MPs which showed that 
41 of them believed there would be a change of leadership. 
  Lord Wakeham, Leader of the House of Lords, used a letter to 
his former constituency of Colchester South to issue a general 
call to Tories for loyalty to Mr Major. "Our support for him 
should not only be loyalty to a proven winner, but also backing 
for a man who has ideas, ambitions and ability to take Britain 
to success in the 21st century," Lord Wakeham said. 
  Their calls were described as "ritualistic" by one leading 
right-wing Tory MP. "John Major has done himself great damage. 
There will not be a coup next week. It will depend on how we 
do in the local and European elections. But there will be a 
stalking horse candidate this autumn. There's little doubt 
about that," he said. However, Tory right wingers said last 
night that they would support Mr Major because there was no 
credible right-wing candidate. Mr Portillo, 40, was too young 
and they still regarded Mr Heseltine as an interventionist 
left-winger. If a challenge does take place, they will press Mr 
Portillo to stand to secure key commitments, including no 
British entry into a single European currency. 
  Three of the Tory MPs who have been rumoured as possible 
stalking horses -- Teresa Gorman, Tony Marlow and Sir Richard 
Body -- appeared to rule themselves out. 
  The odds against Mr Major surviving have shortened from 
evens 
to 11/10 against over the past 24 hours. The Prime Minister 
told journalists at his Huntingdon Conservative Club at the 
weekend that he would not be forced out by the speculation. "It 
hasn't stopped me in the past two years. It isn't going to stop 
me now."
