<F P=106> [Editorial: "There Are Signs of Conservative Party Changing </F>
Its Leader"] 
  [Text] In local government elections across Britain 
yesterday, the Conservatives suffered their worst defeat ever, 
losing control of 17 regional councils and 444 seats. As the 
ruling party, the Tories took just 27 percent of the vote, two 
percentage points lower than their rating in the polls. The 
results of the local elections showed that the Tories were 
reduced to the third party nationally, behind the Liberal 
Democrats and the Labour Party. 
  The Labour Party controls 90 local councils, whereas the 
Conservatives only control 13, with a sharp contrast in strength 
between the two sides. 
  The Liberal Democrats had a net gain of 378 seats. Even some 
former Conservative members of parliament announced publicly to 
reporters that they would vote for the Liberal Democrats. Of 
course, this was a measure taken by Tories under circumstances 
of an inevitable defeat to reduce losses by encouraging 
constituents, who resent the Tories, to vote for the Liberal 
Democrats rather than Labour. 
  In the deep sorrow of defeat, some Conservatives are 
secretly 
feeling happy. They resent John Major's leadership, and would 
most willingly link Major's incompetence and lack of vision with 
the bitter defeat in the local elections. Even before all of 
the results were known, some Tories openly announced their 
determination to challenge John Major's position and remove him 
from office as early as possible. The right-winger Michael 
Portillo added salt to the wound by starting a dispute over the 
European issue, and highlighted John Major's image as a loser 
who fails to command. Obviously, all of these actions were long 
planned and are aimed at making John Major suffer an even 
greater defeat in the European Parliament elections scheduled 
for 9 June. 
  Before 9 June, nobody will officially challenge for the 
position of party leader. But he who is in office must suffer 
the pain of electoral defeat. After 9 June, John Major will 
have to answer for all of the disasters, and it is time to use 
him as a scapegoat. 
  John Major is someone who was propped up by Mrs. Thatcher, 
who supported appointing the mediocre John Major as her 
successor when she was utterly isolated so that one day she 
would be able to pull strings from behind the scenes and 
continue to pursue the Thatcher line. Nevertheless, people 
around John Major seriously pushed him to betray Thatcher's 
doctrine, while pursuing entirely new "leftist" policies and 
affecting John Major's moves. 
  For a very long period, right-wingers and left-wingers 
argued 
over many domestic and world issues. John Major has always been 
weak and powerless, and vacillates to the left and to the right 
resulting in his own "crisis of honor." On the European issue, 
he stressed the imperative of maintaining the sovereignty, 
cultural traditions, and life-style of each country of the 
future European Union, while reflecting the islanders' mind set. 
On the one hand, he expressed the will to join the European 
family; on the other, he made one big stride closer to the 
right. While great skill is needed to have one's bread buttered 
on both sides, John Major has been relatively stupid in such 
circumstance. When expounding on such concepts, he set out a 
campaign to "return to basic values," with an emphasis on 
citizen self-discipline, taking social responsibility and 
obligations, and being upright. However, one scandal surfaced 
after another in his cabinet; consequently, British citizens saw 
how bombastic Major could be and how he failed to know himself. 
The scandals caused Major's reputation to collapse. 
  For a long time, John Major has failed to resolve the 
economic crisis and has seriously jeopardized the interests of 
British people, who have become poorer with each passing day and 
suffer from a high rate of unemployment. At this critical 
juncture, John Major went back on promises made during the 
election campaign by increasing value-added tax on domestic 
fuel; as a result, things became even harder for the poor. He 
promised to reduce public expenditure, but on the contrary, it 
rose by 45.5 percent. [as published] John Major has become an 
expert in making "empty promises," while constituents continue 
to scorn this dishonest prime minister. 
  Many Conservatives believe that John Major is driven by a 
gambler's mind set. At a time when his reputation was waning, 
he wanted to start an offensive in the arena of difficult world 
issues, regardless of British national strength. This being the 
case, he wanted to try his luck in Bosnia, as well as policy 
toward China; however, he was helpless in dealing with domestic 
economic issues which would only lead Britain to an impasse. It 
will be difficult for John Major to lead the Tories in the next 
general election; therefore, news spread earlier this year that 
John Major would be replaced. 
  The setback which has resulted from defeats in the local 
elections is heavier than expected. To accelerate a leadership 
reshuffle, Conservatives have spread the opinion that "John 
Major is not up to his office." 
  However, if politicians 
from various factions compete for office by taking a 
laissez-faire attitude, the Tory unity will be jeopardized. 
This being the case, a planned transfer of power, especially 
the reorganization of the cabinet and the replacement of the 
party chairman, is necessary. When the new party chairman is 
elected, the question of who will replace John Major will be 
settled too. Word has spread that John Major wants Chris Patten 
to become Conservative Party chairman; however, this proposal 
was rejected. That should have been a party secret; making 
public such an inside story would only provide evidence of 
political reality, namely, many Conservatives did not agree to 
Chris Patten contending for this position. There are no grounds 
to allow a politician who has lost a previous electoral campaign 
to canvass votes in the next one under unfavorable electoral 
circumstances. That would only aggravate the Tory's poor image 
as a party which enjoys little public support and has few 
talents. In actual fact, should John Major set out such a line 
in appointing people, that would only give more evidence of his 
poor ability, insight, and lack of judgment, as well as his 
self-knowledge. Now, it is just a matter of time until he 
leaves office; but nobody will let him make arrangements for the 
transfer of power. Work to seek a new leader will be conducted 
by veteran Tories; how can John Major be qualified for such a 
task?
