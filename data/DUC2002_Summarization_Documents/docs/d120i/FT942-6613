Last year a biography of Mrs Norma Major - or, if we are being
old-fashioned, Mrs John Major - claimed that the Majors' favourite film was
Being There. I entirely concur with their choice.
In case you did not see that marvellous film, this, in essence, was the
plot: a man no one knows anything about, a gardener called Chauncey, rises
without trace to become, by the end of the film, a serious candidate for the
US presidency.
Chauncey, played by Peter Sellers, utters only mundane sentiments in a
halting monotone but this convinces the Republican party's power brokers
that he is a sure-fire winner. In Chauncey's bromides everyone seems to hear
what they want to believe. He has a deadly innocence. No wonder the Majors
liked this film.
John Major must, at some level, have appreciated the similarity between his
own, strangely intangible, rise and that of Chauncey's. If he did not see
the similarity, that is still more revealing.
Do not protest that the urban John Major could not identify with a gardener.
In an interview with Farmers Weekly, a few days ago, Major disclosed an
unknown fact: his father was once a farmer.
Farmers Weekly, you see, had asked Major how he had 'such obvious empathy
with agriculture'. (Well, it was obvious to Farmers Weekly, anyway.) And
Major replied: 'It's simple. My father was a farmer. He lived on a small
farm somewhere in Shropshire.'
Francis Wheen of The Guardian, a keen student of Major's mysterious past,
immediately rang 10 Downing Street, which claimed that Major's father farmed
near Bromsgrove in 1910.
As Wheen pointed out, Major was an unresponsive minus 33 years old at that
time, and - a minor point this - Bromsgrove is not in Shropshire. This, of
course, does not mean that Major made everything up. Family folklore is a
peculiar thing.
Yet when I heard about this, my mind immediately went back to an incident a
few months ago, when Major visited Pittsburgh, centre of the US steel
industry, as part of his American tour. I recall that he made a great hit by
recounting that his father had been a steelworker in the city. A farmer for
Farmers Weekly, a Pittsburgh steelworker for the American audience . . . a
pattern emerges. Major's father, and therefore by extension John Major
himself, can be all things to all people.
If John Major were a different sort of politician, this would be a point
barely worth making. But it does seem all of a piece with Major's approach
to wider political issues.
On the one hand he will appeal to the pro-Europeans in his own party by
claiming to want Britain to be at the heart of Europe. On the other he is
free with insulting references to the European Commission, whenever it is
necessary to appeal to an audience of Euro-sceptics.
There are those who will argue that this merely means that Major is a
typical democratic politician, that one who wants to become prime minister
in a democracy must recognise many constituencies of interest, not just one.
But that has not been true of Major's most recent Conservative predecessors.
Margaret Thatcher was notoriously dogmatic, even in public, and so too was
Edward Heath, even though he always pretended to be a 'consensus
politician'. No, Major's technique is very much his own invention, very much
a reflection of his own particular character, itself a product of his
unsettled family background.
His father, Tom Major-Ball, was an itinerant figure, moving from place to
place, trying his hand at any number of occupations, including the circus.
No wonder the young John Major learned the skill of fitting in with
prevailing circumstances, no matter how fluctuating.
The only problem is the old one: you cannot fool all of the people all of
the time. Except in the movies.
