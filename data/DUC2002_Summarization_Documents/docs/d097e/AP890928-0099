   It's taken the devastation caused by
Hurricane Hugo to stimulate repayment of a 211-year-old debt
between two cities almost 1,000 miles apart.
   As a way of repaying a kindness dating to 1778, Kingston is
raising money to help Charleston, S.C., recover.
   After Kingston, then New York's capital, was burned in October
1777 by the British, New York Gov. George Clinton received a letter
from South Carolina Gov. Abraham Livingston. The letter included
nearly 1,000 New York pounds to help Kingston residents get through
their crisis.
   ``This money has been received for the charitable purpose of
alleviating the distresses of the now-indigent inhabitants of the
town of Kingston, who by the ravages of the enemy are reduced to
poverty and want,'' Livingston wrote on March 31, 1778.
   Kingston Historian Edwin Ford remembered the letter when
Hurricane Hugo ravaged the Carolinas last week. ``I figured they
helped us, we should do something for them,'' Ford said.
   On Wednesday, a local Red Cross chapter began collecting
donations for victims of the hurricane.
   ``A lot of people have been calling, asking to send donations
down there,'' said Susan Lawlor, executive director of the Ulster
County Chapter of the Red Cross.
   On Tuesday, New York state sent two airplanes full of food,
clothing and water to parts of the Caribbean ravaged by Hugo. A New
York National Guard C-5A cargo plane also left Tuesday to pick up
equipment in Mississippi and take it to Puerto Rico.
   Another cargo plane was scheduled to leave Stewart Air Force
Base in Newburgh, taking 70 tons of food, water and other supplies
to Puerto Rico.
