   On the stage where Leonard Bernstein made his
sensational New York Philharmonic conducting debut 47 years ago,
the orchestra remembered the maestro at a concert that included
selections from his ``Mass'' and ``Chichester Psalms.''
   Wednesday's midday concert at Carnegie Hall also came on the
90th birthday of the late composer-conductor's close friend, Aaron
Copland. And it was the 36th anniversary of the first TV broadcast
by Bernstein, who died Oct. 16.
   Speakers, introducing various selections and often quoting from
Bernstein's writings, included Bernstein's three children,
son-in-law and friends Lauren Bacall and Schuyler Chapin.
   Bernstein's daughter Jamie Thomas said her father had loved
numerical coincidences ``and today there's a flock of them.''
   The concert began with selections from Bernstein's ``Mass,''
which he composed for the opening of the Kennedy Center for
Performing Arts in Washington, and ended with Psalm 133, in Hebrew,
from Bernstein's ``Chichester Psalms.''
   Conductors were Michael Tilson Thomas, Michael Barrett,
Christoph Eschenbach and James Levine. The orchestra played the
overture to Bernstein's ``Candide'' with a symbolically empty
podium, which brought tears to some of the invited audience and a
standing ovation.
   Cellist Mstislav Rostropovich played a Bach sarabande. Singers
were the Westminster Choir, mezzo-sopranos Marilyn Horne and
Christa Ludwig, soprano Clamma Dale, tenor Jerry Hadley and
baritones Thomas Hampson and Chester Ludgin.
   First chair musicians from the Boston Symphony, Israel
Philharmonic, London Symphony, Santa Cecilia Orchestra and Vienna
Philharmonic flew here, at their orchestras' expense, to take part.
   Two pieces by Copland were played. The concert also included
Schumann, Haydn and Mahler as well as excerpts from six Bernstein
works.
   Bernstein was the New York Philharmonic's 25-year-old assistant
conductor on Nov. 14, 1943, when he filled in at the last minute
for an ailing Bruno Walter.
