   Beverly Sills, Lauren Bacall, Betty Comden
and Phyllis Newman are among performers who will sing, act and make
guest appearances at a birthday bash in August for conductor
Leonard Bernstein.
   The Leonard Bernstein Gala Birthday Performance is a benefit
concert scheduled for the composer's 70th birthday, Aug. 25, to
raise money for the Tanglewood Music Center, where Bernstein got
his conducting start.
   Sills will be host. Performances will include the Boston
Symphony Orchestra, the Boston Pops Orchestra and the Tanglewood
Festival Chorus under the direction of some of the many conductors
whose careers have been guided by Bernstein.
   Bacall and soprano Barbara Hendricks will perform a movement
from Bernstein's Symphony No. 3, ``Kaddish.'' Violin soloist Midori
will play two movements from his ``Serenade.''
   The concert will celebrate Bernstein's accomplishments in
popular music with excerpts from ``West Side Story,'' ``On the
Town'' and others. Dame Gwyneth Jones and Frederica von Stade will
be among those performing highlights from ``Fidelio,'' ``Tristan
und Isolde'' and other works to honor Bernstein's landmark opera
recordings.
   Tickets start at $20 for a spot on the lawn and run up to $5,000
for benefactors, who get a seat in the open-air auditorium.
