   Hurricane Gilbert slammed into Kingston
on Monday with torrential rains and 115 mph winds that ripped roofs
off homes and buildings, uprooted trees and downed power lines.
   No serious injuries were immediately reported in the city of
750,000 people, which was hit by the full force of the hurricane
around noon.
   For half an hour, the hurricane lashed the city, tearing
branches from trees, blowing down fences and whipping paper through
the air.
   The National Weather Service reported heavy damage to Kingston's
airport and aircraft parked on its fields.
   The first shock let up as the eye of the storm moved across the
city. Skies brightened, the winds died down and people waited for
an hour before the second blow of the hurricane arrived.
   All Jamaica-bound flights were canceled at Miami International
Airport.
   Flights from the Cayman Islands, reportedly next in the path of
the hurricane, arrived in Miami packed with travelers cutting short
their vacations. ``People were running around in the main lobby of
our hotel (on Grand Cayman Island) like chickens with their heads
cut off,'' said one man.
   A National Weather Service report said the hurricane was moving
west at 17 mph with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph. It said
Jamaica would receive up to 10 inches of rain that would cause
flash floods and mud slides.
   ``Right now it's actually moving over Jamaica,'' said Bob
Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
   ``It looks like the eye is going to move lengthwise across that
island, and they're going to bear the full brunt of this powerful
hurricane,'' he said.
   Gilbert reached Jamaica after skirting southern Puerto Rico,
Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Hurricane warnings were issued
Monday for the south coast of Cuba east of Camaguey, the Cayman
Islands, and Haiti, while warnings were discontinued for the
Dominican Republic.
   High winds and heavy rain preceding the storm drenched Kingston
overnight, toppling trees, causing local flooding and littering
streets with branches.
   Most of Jamaica's 2.3 million people stayed home, boarding up
windows in preparation for the hurricane.
   The popular north coast resort area, on the other side of the
mountains, was expected to receive heavy rain but not as much
damage from the hurricane as the south coast, where officials urged
residents to seek higher ground.
   Havana Radio, meanwhile, reported Monday that 25,000 people were
evacuated from coastal areas in Guantanamo Province on the nation's
southeastern coast as Gilbert's winds and rain began to brush the
island.
   In Washington, the Navy reported its bases at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, and Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, had taken various
precautionary steps but appeared to be safe from the brunt of the
hurricane.
   Lt. Ken Ross, a spokesman, said the Navy station at Guantanamo
reported that as of 2:30 p.m. EDT, the brunt of the storm appeared
to be passing southeastern Cuba. ``They have reported maximum winds
of 25 knots and gusts up to 50 knots,'' said Ross. ``But there are
no reports of injuries or damage.''
   The spokesman said earlier in the day, Guantanamo had moved to
``Condition Two,'' meaning electrical power usage was cut back to
only essential uses and ``all non-essential personnel sent to their
barracks.''
   The storm also skirted Puerto Rico without causing any damage to
military facilities, Ross said.
   Sheets said Gilbert was expected next to sweep over the Cayman
Islands, on its westward track, and in two to three days veer
northwest into the southern Gulf of Mexico. Residents of the
neighboring Caymans, a British dependency to the northwest, were
urged to ``rush all preparatory actions.''
   The National Weather Service warned that the Caymans could
expect high waters and large waves ``which may undermine buildings
along the beaches.''
   ``All interests in the Western Caribbean should continue to
monitor the progress of this dangerous hurricane,'' the service
advised.
   Forecaster Hal Gerrish on Sunday described Gilbert ``certainly
one of the larger systems we've seen in the Caribbean for a long
time.''
