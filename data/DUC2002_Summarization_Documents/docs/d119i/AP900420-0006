   President Bush is expected to name a female
career diplomat as U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua as that country
prepares for a new era under President-elect Violeta Chamorro,
according to informed sources.
   The sources said Thursday it is virtually certain the
appointment will go to Melissa Wells, 57, currently ambassador to
Mozambique.
   They said the administration believed a female ambassador could
relate better than a man to Mrs. Chamorro, who takes office
Wednesday.
   They also said the administration is eager to have more women in
key posts. Only rarely have U.S. ambassadorships in Latin America
gone to women.
   In choosing Ms. Wells, the administration passed over several
male career diplomats with long experience in that region, said the
sources, who asked not to be identified.
   Ms. Wells, who was born in Estonia, has no prior experience in
Latin America. Her personnel record indicates she speaks Spanish.
   Wells' name was submitted to the White House by Secretary of
State James A. Baker III for the Managua post, and approval is
considered ``99.9 percent certain,'' one source said.
   The United States and Nicaragua have not had ambassadors in each
other's capitals since July 1988.
   The Sandinista government expelled then-U.S. ambassador Richard
Melton and seven other U.S. diplomats on the grounds they were
interfering in Nicaragua's internal affairs.
   The Reagan administration retaliated by expelling Nicaraguan
Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann and seven of his subordinates from the
Nicaraguan embassy here.
   But a new era in U.S.-Nicaraguan relations is expected to open
with the inauguration of Mrs. Chamorro, who defeated President
Daniel Ortega in elections this February.
   Vice President Dan Quayle and a large congressional delegation
are expected to represent Bush at her inaugural.
   The administration has asked Congress for $300 million in
assistance to Nicaragua, part of which would be used for resettling
Contra rebels. But the request has been stalled by Senate
Democrats, some of whom believe that Eastern Europe has a greater
claim on U.S. resources than Nicaragua.
   Wells' nomination as ambassador to Mozambique in 1986
encountered strong opposition from Senate conservatives who held up
the appointment for 11 months in protest against U.S. policy toward
that country.
   The nomination finally was approved in September 1987.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., a leader of the campaign to hold up
Wells' nomination, said he wanted to pressure the administration
into dealing with rightist guerrillas opposed to Mozambique's
Marxist government.
   Mozambique has since moderated its policies and is now off the
U.S. government's list of countries under Marxist rule.
