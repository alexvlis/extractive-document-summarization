   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today
endorsed the nomination of Michigan Republican activist Peter F.
Secchia as ambassador to Italy, but the panel's chairman said he
feared Secchia might ``embarrass the United States'' because of his
``penchant for making gross remarks.''
   The committee's vote was 13-0 in favor of Secchia, a former
Republican national committeeman for Michigan and lumber industry
executive.
   The chairman, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., and Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., voted ``present,'' meaning they took no
position.
   Pell inserted into the hearing record newspaper accounts
``containing the distasteful specifics of Mr. Secchia's remarks.''
   At his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Secchia pledged
to be far more careful as a diplomat in his use of colorful
language than he had been in his different role as a political
organizer and enthusiast.
   But Pell said he was unpersuaded.
   ``Tact and careful speech are hallmarks of successful
diplomats,'' Pell said. ``Mr. Secchia has demonstrated that he
would bring opposite qualities to the position of ambassador to
Italy.''
   ``Italian friends of mine telephoned me from Rome, aghast at the
prospect of having Mr. Secchia represent the United States in their
country,'' the chairman said.
   ``I believe that this nomination is a mistake, and in all
likelihood Mr. Secchia will be an embarrasment to the
administration and the United States,'' Pell said.
   But he said that since Secchia is ``the president's choice'' he
would not try to block the nomination or delay action on it.
