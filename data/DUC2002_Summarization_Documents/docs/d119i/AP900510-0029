   The Bush administration is expected to name
career diplomat Harry Shlaudeman as the first U.S. ambassador to
Nicaragua in almost two years, a U.S. official says.
   The administration had planned to send another career diplomat,
Melissa Wells, to Managua but had a change of heart after
concluding she might face a prolonged Senate confirmation fight
because she has been a target of conservatives.
   The administration is eager to have an ambassador in Managua
quickly because of the delicate political situation there now that
U.S.-backed President Violeta Chamorro has taken over after almost
11 years of rule by the leftist Sandinista party.
   Mrs. Chamorro faces the demanding challenges of reviving
Nicaragua's bankrupt economy and achieving national reconciliation
after long years of warfare.
   The United States has had no ambassador to Nicaragua since July
1988. At the time, the Sandinista government expelled Ambassador
Richard Melton and seven others at the embassy on grounds they were
interfering in the country's internal affairs.
   The Reagan administration retaliated by expelling eight
Nicaraguan envoys in Washington, including Ambassador Carlos
Tunnermann.
   Shlaudeman, who has served as ambassador to Argentina, Peru,
Brazil and Venezuela, is a premier State Department specialist on
Latin America and is expected to win easy Senate confirmation.
   He retired from the foreign service a year ago but was called
back to duty last fall to serve as a State Department liaison with
the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Shlaudeman, who will turn 64 next week, was approached by a
senior State Department official weeks ago about going to Managua
but said he was not interested.
   He told intimates he would agree to go only if asked personally
by President Bush. When Bush telephoned him earlier this week,
Shlaudeman agreed to the appointment, the U.S. official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday.
   In addition to his ambassadorial posts, Shlaudeman was the top
Latin America aide to President Ford in the mid-1970s and a
diplomatic trouble-shooter in Central America under President
Reagan.
   The U.S. official said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and several of
his conservative allies would not assure the administration that
they would not delay Wells' nomination.
   When Wells was nominated to be ambassador to Mozambique in late
1986, Helms and his colleagues blocked her appointment for 11
months. They took the action as a means of expressing opposition to
the Reagan administration's friendship toward Mozambique's Marxist
government.
