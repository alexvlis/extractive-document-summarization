<P>
The space shuttle Discovery brought a thundering end to years of frustration 
when it blasted off Tuesday to extend human vision to the very edge of the 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
The Discovery roared to a record high orbit of 381 miles, where its crew today 
will ever-so-carefully deploy the Hubble Space Telescope, billed as the finest 
optical instrument ever created, a $1.5-billion scope that is half a billion 
times more powerful than the human eye. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years behind schedule, the telescope will be deployed by astronaut Steven 
Hawley, an astronomer, on a day that many scientists were beginning to doubt 
they would ever see. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been long and frustrating," conceded Edward Weiler, program scientist for 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, who was visibly shaken by 
the launch. 
</P>
<P>
"Every astronomer," he said softly, "should take today off." 
</P>
<P>
The launch marked the beginning of an era -- some say a revolution -- in the 
exploration of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
"After 12 years," astronomer Eric Chaisson of the Space Telescope Science 
Institute said with a sigh, "it has finally left the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
High above the haze of the Earth's atmosphere, the Hubble is expected to 
produce images 10 times sharper than even the largest telescopes on Earth 
today. The telescope will not get down to serious science until it completes a 
seven-month checkout and engineering period. Then scientists will begin 
studying some of the dimmest and most distant objects in the universe. 
</P>
<P>
After the deployment, engineers at the Goddard Space Flight Center will begin 
the tedious process of activating the telescope. Although scientific images 
that should tell much about the origin and evolution of the universe will not 
be released for several months, there will be a few teasers early on. 
</P>
<P>
In about seven days the Hubble should snap its first picture -- what 
astronomers call "first light" for the telescope -- but it will be primarily an 
engineering exercise and the image is not expected to amount to much. The 
image, of a cluster of stars in the southern sky, will be taken during the 
beginning of the focusing phase, so it may not even be in focus. 
</P>
<P>
But it will still represent a historic moment. 
</P>
<P>
"The stars may be so out of focus they look like doughnuts," said Caltech's 
James Westphal, principal scientist for the telescope's wide field camera. "But 
however it comes out, it's going to be great." 
</P>
<P>
It will mark the moment when humans freed themselves from the fuzzy view from 
Earth and looked to the heavens with absolute clarity. There will be other 
space telescopes in the years ahead, but there will never be another moment 
quite like this. 
</P>
<P>
"Every bit of 12 years was worth it," Weiler said moments after Discovery 
lifted off on a sunny day, pierced a fleecy white cloud and emerged on the 
other side like a spacecraft on a journey to the future. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, some who have worked so hard for so long were forced to miss the launch. 
They were here two weeks ago, but when the launch was delayed because of a 
hydraulic problem they returned to their homes, and many agencies had not 
budgeted for two trips to Cape Canaveral. 
</P>
<P>
Weiler estimated that only about one-third of the people who were here April 10 
made it back for Tuesday's launch. Among the missing were most of the families 
who had accompanied scientists in hopes of seeing this little bit of history. 
</P>
<P>
There was only one small snag in the otherwise perfect launch when a valve 
failed to close automatically, halting the countdown at 31 seconds before 
launch. The valve was ordered by computer to correct its position, and it did 
so, clearing the way for the countdown to resume. 
</P>
<P>
That delayed the launch about four minutes. But at 5:34 a.m. PDT, with Air 
Force Col. Loren J. Shriver, 45, sitting in the commander's seat, the shuttle 
lifted off. 
</P>
<P>
All five members of the crew are veterans of previous flights. This is the 
second flight for Charles F. Bolden Jr., 43, the pilot, and mission specialists 
Bruce McCandless, 52, and Kathryn D. Sullivan, 38. It is the third flight for 
Hawley, 38. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan and McCandless will be partially suited for a spacewalk today just in 
case anything goes wrong during the deployment of the telescope. The most 
anxious moments will come as Hawley gently lifts the 25,000-pound instrument 
out of its tight quarters in the cargo bay. 
</P>
<P>
He will do that with the shuttle's robotic arm, which he tested in the first 
hours of the flight. The arm, however, tends to drift slightly, so he will have 
his hands full keeping the telescope from banging into the sides of the payload 
bay as he lifts it. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers will not breathe freely until the telescope's two giant solar arrays 
are unfurled. The solar arrays keep the telescope's high-tech batteries 
charged, and if they are not fully deployed within six hours after the 
telescope is lifted out of the cargo bay, the batteries will have discharged to 
the point that some instruments in the telescope could be damaged. 
</P>
<P>
So Sullivan and McCandless will be ready to step outside and manually unfurl 
the solar arrays if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
After the telescope is released and functioning on its own, the Discovery will 
back off about 40 miles and shepherd the scope around Earth for two days. If 
anything goes wrong during that period, the shuttle can rendezvous with the 
telescope and McCandless and Sullivan can go out and work on the problem. 
</P>
<P>
If there are no problems, Discovery will land at 6:49 a.m. PDT Sunday at 
Edwards Air Force Base.
