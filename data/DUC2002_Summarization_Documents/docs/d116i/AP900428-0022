   The shuttle that put the Hubble Space
Telescope into orbit also carries an instrument used in the 1920s
by astronomer Edwin Hubble: the eyepiece from what once was the
world's most powerful telescope.
   ``It's a great pleasure to have something of such historical
significance and something that so directly symbolizes Edwin
Hubble's fundamental contributions to astronomy,'' astronaut Kathy
Sullivan said Friday as she circled the Earth in space shuttle
Discovery.
   The eyepiece from the Mount Wilson Observatory's 100-inch Hooker
Telescope was carried into orbit by Sullivan. After she brings the
eyepiece back to Earth, it will be placed on display at the
observatory.
   ``It's basically a symbolic gesture from the past of astronomy
to the future of astronomy,'' said Lyn McAfee, spokeswoman for the
Mount Wilson Institute. The Pasadena-based group runs the
observatory, located in the San Gabriel Mountains outside Los
Angeles.
   ``The discoveries made by Hubble on the 100-inch telescope at
Mount Wilson gave us a giant leap forward in our understanding of
the universe,'' McAfee said. ``We believe the Hubble Space
Telescope will do the same thing.''
   The Hooker Telescope was the world's most powerful telescope
from its construction in 1918 until 1948, when the 200-inch Hale
Telescope was placed in operation at Mount Palomar Observatory
northeast of San Diego.
   Using the Hooker Telescope, Hubble was the first to determine
the distance to a galaxy outside the Milky Way, the institute said
in a statement.
   ``This crucial discovery provided the first definite proof that
other galaxies existed far beyond the confines of our own local
galaxy,'' the institute said.
   During the 1920s and 1930s, Hubble and an assistant used the
Hooker telescope to take thousands of photographs of faint
galaxies, showing that most of them were moving away from each
other very quickly.
   ``This provided observational evidence for the concept,
suggested by Einstein's Theory of Relativity, that the universe is
expanding,'' the institute said.
   Hubble's work helped convince scientists the universe was
created in a giant explosion, called the ``big bang,'' an estimated
15 billion years ago.
   The Hooker Telescope was mothballed in 1985 by the Carnegie
Institution, former operator of the observatory, in a money-saving
move. The institute hopes to obtain funds to reopen it.
