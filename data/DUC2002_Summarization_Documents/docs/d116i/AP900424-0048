   Five astronauts boarded Discovery
today for a second try at sending the Hubble Space Telescope into
orbit to scan the outermost reaches of the universe for clues to
the beginning of time.
   ``Astronomers are starting to tingle again in anticipation of
what the Hubble will be able to accomplish,'' said Lennard Fisk,
head of NASA science activities.
   Air Force forecasters said there was a 90 percent chance the
weather would be favorable for launching the shuttle at the
scheduled time of 8:31 a.m. EDT.
   More than a half million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid
oxygen were pumped into the space ship's fuel tanks after midnight.
The astronauts, wearing bright orange flight suits, climbed into
the crew cabin just as dawn was breaking over the Kennedy Space
Center.
   The $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's costliest cargo, will give
astronomers ``a new set of eyes and ears that we don't have,'' said
William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program.
   ``It's going to change our perspective altogether. I can't say
what we're going to learn, but I'll be astounded if we don't learn
many new things.''
   Discovery was aiming for an altitude of 380 miles, the highest a
shuttle has ever gone, so the telescope can be placed in its proper
orbit far above Earth's distorting atmosphere. It is the 35th
shuttle mission.
   Columbia, which journeys into space next month with the Astro
observatory, sat on a launch pad 1.6 miles from Discovery, only the
second time both pads have been occupied; the first was in 1986
just before the Challenger explosion.
   Hubble has been waiting to take its place in space since 1983,
delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident. The
latest postponement occurred April 10, when Discovery's launch was
scrubbed four minutes before liftoff because of a faulty power unit
on the shuttle.
   The mood at the Kennedy Space Center was considerably less
festive than during the first launch attempt, when hundreds of
astronomers gathered with their families.
   The day after launch, mission specialist Steven A. Hawley will
use the shuttle's mechanical arm to lift the 24,250-pound telescope
into space. Veteran spacewalkers Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn
Sullivan will assist if a problem develops.
   Discovery will follow Hubble from 40 miles away for two days
until after its lens cap is opened, exposing the finely polished
94.5-inch mirror to starlight.
   Hubble is not expected to start providing scientific data by
satellite for a month or more after liftoff. However, NASA said it
will release its first image _ an open star cluster in the
constellation Carina _ a week after launch.
   In addition to the $1.5 billion cost of Hubble, $500 million has
been spent on spare parts, astronaut training and computer software
to operate the instrument. The European Space Agency contributed
$250 million for 15 percent of the viewing time.
   NASA estimates it will cost $200 million a year to operate and
maintain the telescope in space.
   During its 15-year working lifetime, the telescope will provide
astronomers with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more
sensitivity than ground-based observatories. As a result, they will
be able to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has been
traveling toward Earth for 14 billion years.
   Astronomers hope to learn whether the universe was created 15
billion years ago as believed and uncover some of the mystery
surrounding galaxies, black holes and quasars. Hubble also is
expected to shed light on how and when the universe might end.
   The telescope is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble,
who discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding. His
work gave rise to the Big Bang theory that the universe was created
by a tremendous explosion.
   In addition to Hubble, Discovery carries a human skull filled
with sensors to measure the space radiation that astronauts
receive. It is the skull's third trip into space.
   The shuttle is to end its five-day mission with a landing at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
