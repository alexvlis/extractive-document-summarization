  [Text] Changsha, June 19 (XINHUA) -- This capital of 
central China's Hunan province has been hit by floods in the 
wake of a succession of rainstorms on the upper and middle 
reaches of the Xiangjiang River. 
  The water level of the river, which flows through Changsha, 
is still rising sharply, according to local sources. 
  By four o'clock this afternoon the level recorded at the 
Changsha monitoring station had risen to 38.93 m, some 0.56 m 
higher than the highest figure ever previously recorded. The 
flood has caused serious losses to people along both banks of 
the river, especially in Changsha, according to the sources. 
  In the early hours of yesterday six villages and one fishing 
ground at Yulushan township were flooded when an embankment 
collapsed. 
  Most of the 15,000 people affected by the flood there have 
been evacuated to safer places. 
  By six o'clock yesterday afternoon 19 dykes in the Changsha 
area had collapsed, and a total of 128,000 urban and rural 
residents had been affected. 
  A partial collapse of the grand Longwangang embankment at 
the 
Xihu fishing ground in the Wangyuehu district of Changsha has 
put the lives and property of 60,000 people in danger. 
  But thanks to the concerted rescue efforts of 2,000 local 
cadres, residents and soldiers there was no loss of life. 
  The city government of Changsha has asked residents within 
the endangered areas to relocate themselves and remove their 
property to safer places, in case of the occurrence of more 
serious flooding. 
  By the early hours of this morning roads and surfaces of 
bridges in the Wangyuehu district had been inundated. The flood 
waters had also reached the boulevard along the Xiangjiang 
River, Xiahe Street and the western part of Zhongshan Street in 
Changsha proper. 
  So far, more than 500,000 soldiers and local residents have 
moved in to help fight the floods. 
  Meanwhile, the Changsha city committee of the Communist 
Party 
has held an emergency meeting, urging all departments and the 
people of the whole city to carry forward the spirit of 
continuous fighting and unite as one in battling the floods. 
  Wang Maolin, secretary of the Hunan Provincial Party 
Committee, who is now in the province's southern city of Zhuzhou 
to direct anti-flood efforts there. In a telephone call to the 
Changsha city government, he called on local officials to adopt 
effective measures, ensure the safety of the lives and property 
of the residents of Changsha and make an overall success of the 
work to conquer the flood.
