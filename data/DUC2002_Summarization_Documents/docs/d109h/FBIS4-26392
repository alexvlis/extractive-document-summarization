  [Text] Beijing, 21 Jun (XINHUA) -- According to the State 
Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, after the largest 
or the second largest flood peaks since the liberation of China 
occurred a few days ago in the Xi Jiang, Bei Jiang, Xiang Jiang, 
and Gan Jiang rivers, water levels in these rivers are dropping 
slowly; however, high water levels will remain in these rivers 
for the next few days. Due to interaction of the Bei Jiang and 
Xi Jiang, the Zhujiang Delta will face a high water-level test. 
  Heavy rainfall over a wide area since mid-June resulted in 
the largest flood waters since liberation of the country in the 
Xi Jiang, Bei Jiang, and Xiang Jiang rivers. The flood water in 
Guangdong's Xi Jiang crested in Gaoyao County on 20 June; the 
water level in Gaoyao's Xi Jiang dropped to 13.37 meters at 0600 
today. A flood peak occured in Bei Jiang in Guangdong's Sanshui 
at 0400 on 20 June, raising the water level to 10.39 meters -- 
the largest flood level ever recorded. The water level droppped 
to 10.16 meters at 0600 today. 
  Drops in water levels in Guangdong's Bei Jiang and Xi Jiang 
do not mean that Guangdong's flooding situations have eased, 
because flood waters in the Xi Jiang and Bei Jiang will remain 
at high levels for quite long a period and will enter the sea 
after the two flood waters jointly flow through the low-lying 
Zhujiang Delta. In particular, the sea tide may add to the 
flood waters on 25 June. With these factors combined, the 
Zhujiang Delta, which has a developed economy and a forest of 
factories, will face the most rigorous flood water test since 
the liberation of the country. 
  The situation in the Xiang Jiang is also not an easy one. 
The flood peak passed Changsha on 19 June, but the water level 
at the Changsha Station was still at 25 meters at 0200 today 
[1800 GMT 20 June]. Because the water level has remained high 
for a long period, several dangerous situations have occured 
along the river's dikes. Dike reinforcing work needs to be 
stepped up. 
  The flood peak in Gan Jiang entered Boyang Lake on 20 June. 
However, due to continued rains over the last few days, the 
water level in the upper reaches west of Ganzhou has begun to 
rise again. At 0800 today, the water level at the Ganzhou 
Station was 100.95 meters, 3.45 meters above the warning level.
