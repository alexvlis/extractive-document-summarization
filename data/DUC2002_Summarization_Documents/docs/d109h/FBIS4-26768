<F P=106> [By JIANGXI RIBAO reporter Zhang Wei (1728 3555) and XINHUA </F>
reporter Wu Huaguo (0702 5478 0948)] 
  [Text] Nanchang, 24 Jun (XINHUA) -- A central work team led 
Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau and member of the CPC Central Committee 
Secretariat, arrived in Jiangxi from Hunan this morning to 
provide on-the-spot guideance for Jiangxi to conduct 
flood-fighting and relief work and to resume industrial and 
agricultural production. 
  Immediately after disembarking from the plane, Wen Jiabao 
and 
his party -- accompanied by Mao Zhiyong, secretary of the 
Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee, and Governor Wu Guanzheng -- 
successively rushed to the Nanchang Bridge, the Leigongao 
construction work site along the Nanchang-Jiujiang Highway which 
is reserved for vehicles, Weidong Village under Changling Town 
in Xinjian County, and Houtian Township's Sanzhou Village. They 
inspected the flood situation along the Ganjiang River, visited 
the masses of flood victims, and extended greetings and 
appreciation to the servicemembers and civilians who have been 
performing rescue and emergency tasks. The same evening, Wen 
Jiabao and his party earnestly listened to reports by the 
Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and government on Jiangxi's 
flood situation and its flood-fighting and relief work. 
  Wen Jiabao highly commended Jiangxi's servicemembers and 
people for their spirit that stresses fostering unity and 
coordinated efforts, striving to help and rescue themselves, and 
continually fighting when encountering extraordinarily 
disastrous floods. He also fully affirmed Jiangxi's preliminary 
victories in its flood-fighting and relief work. Wen Jiabao 
pointed out: At present, the Ganjiang River's water-level is 
declining, but the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and 
government are still facing very arduous tasks. While 
continually and properly conducting flood-fighting and relief 
work along the Ganjiang River valleys, we should stress 
flood-prevention in the Poyang Lake area and should promptly 
organize the masses in the disaster-stricken areas to resume 
production so as to be self-reliant and to rebuild their homes. 
Jiangxi is a major agricultural province. We should take 
measures to promptly salvage the early-ripening rice, and should 
expand the planting of late-ripening rice and autumn grain as 
much as possible so as to attain a bumper harvest of grain for 
the whole year. While carrying out flood-fighting and relief 
work, we should also continually and properly handle various 
tasks concerning reform, stability, and development in Jiangxi. 
  It has been learned that on 25 June Wen Jiabao and his party 
will visit other localities including Xingan, Fengcheng, and 
Jian where the flooding has been the most serious. They will 
further inspect the flood situation and extend sympathy and 
solicitude to flood victims there.
