  [Text] Beijing, June 26 (XINHUA) -- Floods have all 
receded along Xijiang, Beijiang, Xiangjiang and Ganjiang except 
at a section of the Xijiang River in Wuzhou city, Guangxi, a 
spokesman from the State Flood Control and Drought Relief 
Headquarters announced today. 
  The spokesman attributed the falling water level to the 
major 
water conservancy projects which help to mitigate losses. 
Meanwhile, he said, tension has been eased in the Pearl River 
delta as the latest tropical storm has been weakened after 
landing in Yangjiang city, Guangdong Province. 
  Floods hit Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujiang and 
Zhejiang provinces following the first heavy rains and floods 
which typically hit China from the south to the north from June 
to August. 
  Earlier reports said that successive torrential rainstorms 
in 
the Xijiang and Beijiang river valleys in early and mid-June 
resulted in a big flood, one of the most serious in 100 years, 
in Guangdong Province and caused heavy losses. Major flood 
monitoring stations on the two rivers recorded their highest 
water levels, all four meters above the warning level. 
  In an urgent conference late yesterday, the Guangdong 
provincial government urged localities to help flood victims 
with food, shelter, clothing and medical care so that no one 
would die of hunger and no epidemic disease would break out in 
the flooded areas. 
  The province has allocated 300 million kg of grain and 110 
million yuan in cash along with over 10 million tons of such 
farm production supplies as chemical fertilizer and diesel oil 
to the flood-stricken areas. 
  Meanwhile, 740 million yuan in loans and another 50 million 
yuan in donations have also been sent to flooded areas in 
Guangdong Province. 
  While inspecting flood control and relief work in Jiangxi 
Province, through which the Ganjiang flows, Wen Jiabao, 
alternate member of the Political Bureau and member of the 
Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, said the flooded areas 
should work hard to mitigate losses through their own efforts 
and with support from various departments. 
  While inspecting Nanchang, the capital city of Jiangxi, and 
Fengcheng, Xingang, Jian and Taihe, on June 24-26, Wen said the 
key to mitigating economic losses is to resume production as 
soon as possible. 
  The localities should waste no time in implementing various 
measures to resume production and rehabilitate their homeland, 
he said. 
  As one of China's major bread baskets, Jiangxi is of key 
importance to China in agricultural production, Wen said. It 
has a direct bearing on the grain supply in south China. He 
urged the local governments to farmers resume agricultural 
production.
