  [Text] Beijing, June 20 (XINHUA) -- Floods continue to have 
serious effects in Guangdong, Hunan and Jiangxi Provinces and 
the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in southern China. 
  Information from the State Flood Control and Drought Relief 
Headquarters revealed that the flood peak on the Xijiang River 
today reached Guangdong Province. 
  By eight o'clock yesterday morning, a peak flood water level 
of 25.91 m [meters] was recorded at the flood monitoring station 
of Guangxi's Wuzhou city, 10.91 m above the danger level. 
  Flood water has entered urban and suburban areas of Wuzhou 
city, and most of its transport and telecommunications with the 
outside were suspended. 
  This city borders Guangdong and lies on the Xunjiang River, 
the name for the upper reaches of the Xijiang River. 
  The speed of the flood-water was recorded as 46,200 cu 
[cubic] m per second, the most ferocious since the founding of 
New China in 1949. 
  The flood peak on the Beijiang River in Guangdong Province 
passed through Qingyuan city by 23:00 hours last night, and the 
water level was recorded as 14.72 m, about 4.22 m above the 
danger mark; the speed was 17,400 cu m per second. 
  Flood control work in the Pearl River (Zhujiang) Delta area 
is also very intense. 
  The State Council, China's highest governing body, recently 
sent a joint working group formed by the Ministries of Water 
Resources, Construction and Civil Affairs to help fight floods 
in Guangxi and in Guangdong. 
  At 11 o'clock on Saturday, the flood peak on the Xiangjiang 
River passed through Changsha city, capital of central China's 
Hunan Province. 
  The water level recorded at the local monitoring station was 
38.93 m, some 3.93 m above danger level. High flood water 
levels were also recorded at Hengyang and Xiangtan cities. 
  About 118 towns of eight prefectures and cities along the 
Xiangjiang River were flooded. 
  Flood water has also entered more than 20 streets and lanes 
of Changsha, and more than 300,000 city dwellers were affected. 
More than 400 factories and 5,000 shops were forced to stop 
production or stop business. 
  More than half a million Armymen and local residents, under 
the leadership of the Hunan provincial party provincial 
committee and provincial people's government, are going all out 
to fight the flood. 
  By 22:00 hours last night, the flood peak passed through 
Nanchang city, provincial capital of Jiangxi. Statistics from 
the local monitoring station show that the flood water level was 
25.42 m, about 2.62 m above the danger mark, and the speed of 
the flood was 19,100 cu m per second. 
  The Jiangxi provincial party committee and people's 
government are mobilizing local people and the troops stationed 
there to combat the floods. 
  The State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters has 
sent special teams of people to help fight floods in Hunan and 
Jiangxi. 
  Meanwhile, drought is continuing to blight most areas of 
northern China and northeastern China, with about 15.3 million 
hectares of land affected. 
  In the drought-stricken areas, 12 million people and 12 
million head of livestock are short of drinking water, according 
to the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters.
