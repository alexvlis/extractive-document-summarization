  [Text] The following is a recorded report filed by this 
station's reporter on the front lines of the province's battle 
against the flooding yesterday. 
  [Begin recording] Dear audience, it is now almost noon on 20 
June. I'm reporting in Changshanyuan at the eastern gate of 
Changsha City. This morning, Provincial Party Committee 
Secretary Wang Maolin, provincial Governor Chen Bangzhu, and 
some other provincial party and government leaders arrived here 
in Changshayuan, on the front line of the province's flood 
resistance effort, to direct the fight against the flooding. 
  Governor Chen Bangzhu and vice Governor Zheng Peimin just 
arrived back in Changsha at about 0700 this morning after 
attending a Beijing meeting. As soon as they stepped out from 
the train, they set out for Changshayuan, the front line of the 
province's flood resistance. I interviewed Governor Chen 
Bangzhu here on the spot. 
  [Reporter] How are you, Governor Chen? You have inspected 
some flood-stricken areas in Changsha City this morning. Will 
you please tell our audience something about the province's 
flood situation? 
  [Governor] This year, Hunan has been hit by a flood of a 
severity unseen for the past 100 years in terms of both water 
level and quantity. Over the past few days, the broad masses of 
Army personnel and people across the province have been bravely 
fighting the flood and have been making concerted efforts to 
provide disaster relief to afflicted areas, with the result that 
some of the province's key dams have remained sound and economic 
losses have been reduced to a minimum. 
  I would like to take this opportunity to extend my warm 
regards and thanks to the broad masses of Army personnel and 
people fighting in the front lines of the province's battle 
against the flood. At the moment, the province's flood 
situation remains very serious, because the water level is still 
high. According to weather forecasts and meteorological 
reports, the province is expecting more rain to fall over the 
next few days. We will definitely encounter more hardships and 
difficulties. Under the current circumstances, the broad masses 
of Army personnel and people across the province should further 
step up their work and devote more energy to flood prevention 
and disaster relief work, this being an overriding task at the 
moment. 
  We are full of confidence that, under the leadership of the 
CPC Central Committee and the State Council, the broad masses of 
the Hunan Army personnel and people will be able to overcome the 
difficulties and hardships caused by natural calamities such as 
flooding, waterlogging, and so on and will win a complete 
victory in the on-going flood prevention and disaster relief 
struggle. [end recording]
