   Marilyn Quayle, wife of Vice President
Dan Quayle, praised the heroism of this tornado-ravaged northern
Alabama city's residents during a visit Saturday.
   Mrs. Quayle personally thanked workers cleaning up the debris
left by Wednesday's twister and visited some of the injured at
Crestwood Hospital during her 2{-hour tour.
   The tornado left 18 people dead, hundreds injured and up to
1,000 homeless. The youngest victim, a 2{-year-old girl, died
Friday after being taken off life-support systems.
   ``The community is filled with heroes _ people who without ...
regard to their own personal danger helped other citizens so that
they could survive,'' said Mrs. Quayle, who was accompanied by Gov.
Guy Hunt and U.S. Sens. Howell Heflin and Richard Shelby.
   Mrs. Quayle, who made similar visits to San Francisco after the
Oct. 17 earthquake and Charleston, S.C., after Hurricane Hugo, also
praised corporations that have made donations to help Huntsville
recover.
   Federal and state officials have promised to do whatever is
necessary to help Huntsville, even if disaster relief funds are
squeezed by Hurricane Hugo and the quake.
   ``We're here to get the job done,'' Grant Peterson, associate
director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said Friday.
``Whatever's needed will be done.''
   President Bush declared Huntsville a disaster area, but FEMA may
have to do some financial juggling to deal with this year's rash of
natural disasters. Parts of eight states have been declared
eligible for federal relief.
   ``Any one disaster like Hugo or the earthquake in California
exceeds ... what we have in a normal year alone,'' Peterson said.
   Congress provided $1.1 billion in supplemental funds to FEMA
after Hugo devastated the Caribbean and the East Coast in
September, and $1.2 billion following the earthquake that ravaged
parts of northern California on Oct. 17.
   So far, about $1.3 billion has been allocated to disaster
victims. Peterson said he's not yet concerned about FEMA meeting
its financial obligations.
   ``I would say that to ask for any more money at this point would
be premature,'' he said.
   Peterson and his aides urged patience during the arduous task of
processing thousands of relief requests from the Huntsville area.
   ``If everything works well, in seven to 10 days we should get
the first checks out,'' Peterson said Friday. ``I'll make sure that
we expedite these requests to meet the people's needs.''
   The state will have to ante up 25 percent of the cost of
providing clothing and temporary housing for tornado victims, with
the federal government pitching in the other 75 percent. Gov. Hunt
said he expected the Alabama Legislature to come up with whatever
money is needed.
   ``The state doesn't budget for disasters,'' said Danny Cooper,
Alabama's emergency management director. ``We take care of them at
the time.''
   Hunt stressed that government agencies won't be able to shoulder
the entire load. He requested donations to agencies such as the
American Red Cross, which set up a shelter for the homeless as
rescue workers dug through the rubble in those desperate hours
after the tornado struck.
   The tornado hit Huntsville with devastating force _ winds were
estimated at 250 mph _ and virtually no warning about 4:30 p.m.
Wednesday, leaving a 10-mile-long path of destruction.
   A shopping center and clusters of apartment buildings were
leveled. Cars were piled atop each other like the remnants of a
demolition derby.
   Cooper said 119 homes were destroyed and 125 had lesser damage.
Three churches, two schools, 35 businesses and 10 public buildings
were either destroyed or suffered heavy damage.
   Neighbors pitched in to help Debra McKay and her family pick
through the rubble of their home. The only things standing were the
walls around two bathrooms and an adjacent hallway _ the area where
Ms. McKay and her three children rode out the storm.
   ``I know the Lord spared us,'' she said. ``I woke up a different
person this morning.''
   Officials said several truckloads of food have rolled into
Huntsville but the city is running out of places to store the goods.
   ``There's a sense of thankfulness,'' Hunt said. ``It's
heartwarming to see how people have come together.''
   Huntsville is home to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, the
Army's Redstone Arsenal and a number of high-tech industries. Mayor
Steve Hettinger said the city would be able to withstand the
tornado's financial impact.
   ``Huntsville has a strong economy, a diverse economy,'' he said.
``That's not the source of our concern.''
