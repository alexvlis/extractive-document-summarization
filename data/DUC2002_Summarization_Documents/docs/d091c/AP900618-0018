   The death toll from flash floods that
swept through a rural area of eastern Ohio rose to 20 Sunday as
searchers dug along two creeks and dived into the Ohio River.
Sixteen people remained missing.
   Workers used shovels and picks to dig along the creek banks, and
sifted through debris at places marked with red flags, where search
dogs indicated they'd detected human scents, said National Guard
Capt. Jim Boling.
   Divers worked where the two creeks empty into the Ohio.
   Four bodies were found Sunday. But two of those were not
immediately identified, and the list of missing was not revised to
account for them.
   The number missing dropped to 16 with the other two bodies and
the removal of two other names: a woman who called to say she was
safe and a person who authorities weren't sure lived in the area,
said coroner's investigator Chuck Vogt.
   The 20th victim was pulled from the mouth of Pipe Creek at the
Ohio River, about seven miles south of Shadyside, Vogt said.
Another body was found in debris along Wegee Creek, and two bodies
were found earlier in the Ohio, he said.
   That brought the confirmed death toll in Thursday's floods to
20, including five children.
   Twenty-three dog teams from four states were searching for
victims, said Boling. The digging will continue at least through
Tuesday, said Fire Chief Mark Badia.
   ``The thing you find once you start into these brush piles and
piles of trees are cars, and they have to be torn apart and
searched separately,'' Badia said. ``Everything you turn up creates
a different situation.''
   But Vogt said he doubted many of the missing would be found
alive.
   ``It's just been too long. I don't think there's anybody alive
out there,'' he said. ``You can't swim out there that long in the
Ohio River.''
   The Wegee and Pipe creeks overflowed Thursday night during
storms that poured 5{ inches of rain onto eastern Ohio in 3{ hours.
The floods destroyed as many as 70 houses and damaged up to 40
others.
   Authorities said Friday that 60 people were missing; some of
those were later found dead, while others notified authorities that
they were safe.
   Officials also learned that some of those feared missing had
moved out of the area. Officials were comparing county property
lists and data from the Census Bureau with information from
residents and relatives, Boling said.
   Investigators Sunday blamed the flash floods on an unusually
heavy rainstorm that overwhelmed the designed flow capacities of
threebridges over the creeks. Badia said rainwater running down
hillsides forced debris into the creeks, forming dams at each
bridge. The ``dams'' broke under the water pressure.
   ``Eventually the bridges couldn't hold any more. The debris
broke loose, and that's when we got three big gushes of water,'' he
said.
   As rescue efforts continued, the National Guard cleared roads
and bridges leading into the stricken area.
   Eighteen Ohio counties have been declared federal disaster areas
since tornadoes and flooding first struck May 25.
   Across the border in West Virginia, Gov. Gaston Caperton said
Sunday he had no precise dollar figure on damage from flooding
Friday along a five-mile stretch near New Martinsville and in
nearby Ohio County, but estimated it will run into millions of
dollars.
   No deaths or serious injuries were reported.
   Caperton toured flooded areas in Wheeling and the Doolin Run
community near New Martinsville. He said he saw ``tremendous
devastation'' to hundreds of houses, house trailers and cars.
   State Public Safety Secretary Joseph Skaff estimated that
repairing and replaceing bridges and roads will cost about $750,000.
   National Guard soldiers helped with cleanup Sunday.
