Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev warned the nation Saturday night that the 
country's growing ethnic strife is endangering its unity as a state as well as 
threatening his program of political and economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Appealing for calm and for the cool consideration of grievances after weeks of 
continuing unrest in scattered areas of the country, Gorbachev made clear the 
leadership's fear that the nation is heading into a political maelstrom that 
could tear the Soviet Union apart. 
</P>
<P>
As president, Gorbachev said, it is his "duty to warn you about the mounting 
danger of worsening inter-ethnic relations and the consequences for society, 
for every family and for every person." 
</P>
<P>
"The fate of perestroika and the unity of our state is at stake," he declared 
in a sober, 20-minute address broadcast on radio and television. "Irresponsible 
slogans, political instigation, setting one national group against another, the 
domination of some ethnic groups by others -- this could lead to disaster for 
us all. 
</P>
<P>
"The living and the succeeding generations will curse those who pushed the 
nation on this course and those who failed to caution it against the dangers 
involved in time to prevent madness." 
</P>
<P>
With serious ethnic clashes in Soviet Central Asia over the past month, with 
troops needed to maintain the peace in the southern republics of Armenia, 
Azerbaijan and Georgia and with nationalism growing stronger in the Baltic 
republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Gorbachev is struggling to hold the 
Soviet Union together as a state while he pushes broad reforms that he believes 
will resolve most of the grievances. 
</P>
<P>
Even as he spoke, Soviet officials reported new violence in the south -- this 
time between Georgians and Azerbaijanis inside the Georgian republic but in an 
area with many Azerbaijanis. Roving gangs, armed with hunting rifles, gasoline 
bombs and other weapons, had clashed in three towns south of the capital of 
Tbilisi last week, leaving one man dead and 22 people seriously wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Although limited so far in scope, some of the ethnic conflicts could grow to 
the point where various regions of the country would be thrown into virtual 
civil war, Gorbachev suggested, and some national republics could find 
themselves in violent disputes with their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Those who encourage the unrest are "playing with fire," Gorbachev said, warning 
that the government will use its full powers and take "the most decisive 
measures" against those provoking the clashes, organizing attacks on minority 
groups or urging secession. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 people have been killed in communal clashes and related political 
disturbances over the past two years; tens of thousands of people have had to 
flee their homes, including 40,000 last month alone, to seek refuge from the 
violence, and nearly 25,000 special troops are now deployed in various parts of 
the country to maintain order. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no pulling of our punches in relation to those who have taken 
the criminal path," Gorbachev said, warning of stern measures against those 
engaged in communal violence or in political agitation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Energy Drained 
</P>
<P>
The ethnic strife, much of it rooted in past Soviet policies of domination by 
ethnic Russians or in the forced deportation of hundreds of thousands of people 
during the Stalinist era, has increasingly drained the political energy 
necessary to push through major reforms and has provided conservative critics 
of reform with a potent argument against faster and broader change. 
</P>
<P>
For Gorbachev, the spread of the unrest has forced the humiliating admission 
that the Soviet Union, a superpower in world terms, cannot ensure the domestic 
tranquility that is a first priority for any government -- nor can it protect 
its own minorities against pogroms. 
</P>
<P>
If the strife here continued and grew, he asked, "What kind of example shall we 
set for others while calling on the whole of mankind to build a nonviolent 
world?" 
</P>
<P>
Of equal gravity for Gorbachev in domestic political terms has been the growth 
of not only nationalism but the appearance of secessionist groups in the Baltic 
republics and in Armenia, Georgia and Moldavia, a Soviet republic on the 
Romanian border. 
</P>
<P>
The whole issue is believed to have been the subject of a high-level Communist 
Party conference here late last week, and Gorbachev's unusual television 
address underscores the threat posed by the conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev acknowledged that ethnic relations are "wound in a tight knot of 
contradictions" because of previous Soviet policies, particularly the effort to 
pull the country's 100-plus ethnic groups into a new "Soviet nationality" with 
a unified culture. 
</P>
<P>
This policy had, in fact, collided head on with growing ethnic awareness 
throughout the country and made the problems even worse. 
</P>
<P>
Past economic policies, including the "stagnation" in many regions under the 
regime of the late President Leonid I. Brezhnev, had also made the problems 
more acute. 
</P>
<P>
"We are also reaping today the results of lawlessness in preceding decades -- 
the deportation of whole peoples from their lands and the burying in oblivion 
of the national interests of small ethnic groups," Gorbachev said, alluding to 
actions carried out decades ago by the dictator Josef Stalin. 
</P>
<P>
"Such excesses resulted in indifference to ethnic interests, to many 
outstanding social and economic problems in constituent republics and 
autonomous regions, deformities in the development of the languages and 
cultures of the country's different peoples, the deteriorating demographic 
situation and many other negative consequences that ultimately provoked tension 
in inter-ethnic relations." 
</P>
<P>
Although these questions will be dealt with during a special meeting of the 
Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee in late July and then debated 
again by the Congress of People's Deputies, the country's new national 
assembly, Gorbachev apparently felt that he could not wait for those debates, 
and he set out his own broad guidelines for dealing with the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Right of Equality 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone, regardless of his nationality, should feel an equal citizen in any 
part of the country and have a possibility to exercise all the rights 
guaranteed by the Soviet Union's constitution," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The refusal to recognize the basic principle of equality had led to attacks on 
minority groups in several parts of the country, Gorbachev said, alluding to 
the particularly vicious assaults on Mesketian Turks in Uzbekistan last month 
in which about 100 people died. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader outlined an approach that would seek to increase the feeling 
of various ethnic groups that they are "at home in their own land" and could 
preserve and develop their own cultures, languages and social traditions, with 
the Soviet Union evolving politically to be much more of a federal system. 
</P>
<P>
But he said that minority communities also need to be protected so that there 
is a balance of rights. "We have lived and will continue to live in a 
multi-ethnic community," he observed. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said that "profound transformations in the Soviet federation" are 
clearly essential, promising further political reforms to make it a real 
federation and not just one in name only. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demands Rejected 
</P>
<P>
But he declared at the same time his firm opposition to near-total independence 
demanded by some nationalists, particularly in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, 
and to the calls by others for the redrawing of the borders of ethnic 
territories. The Soviet Union's ethnic groups have "a common destiny," 
Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
"In quest of the better, one should not embark on the path of destroying what 
has been built and abandoning what has already been given by the federation and 
what can be multiplied within its framework," he said.
