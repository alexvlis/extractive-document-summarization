   The government has decided to give ethnic Germans
and Crimean Tatars who were expelled from their homelands by Josef
Stalin their own autonomous regions but it will take years, Tass
reported Wednesday.
   ``The ice has been broken. A start has been made. We're working
on creating such autonomy,'' said Rafik Nishanov, chairman of a
chamber of the Soviet legislature, in remarks carried by the
official news agency.
   However, he said, the nuts and bolts of how to create the
regions still had to be worked out. ``For example, a 10-year
program on resettlement. People can't just be expelled from the
area for others to move in.''
   The Tatars of the Crimea and the ethnic Germans who lived on the
Volga River were forcibly resettled during World War II, when Josef
Stalin kicked peoples out of their homelands on the grounds they
could not be trusted to occupy strategic areas.
   The Tatars and Germans, among others, long have been agitating
to return from Siberia and Central Asia to their traditional lands,
and last month the Supreme Soviet legislature declared that all
peoples exiled under Stalin should be considered politically
rehabilitated.
   But other people now occupy the lands and houses that belonged
to the exiles, and re-establishing their dominion in their home
regions will not be so simple.
   The Supreme Soviet took the basic decision that the two
autonmous regions should be created on Nov. 28 but kept it quiet,
apparently fearing explosive reactions from the populations now
living in the regions. It was also a potentially dangerous
precedent: The Soviet Union is a patchwork of well over 100 ethnic
groups, and many of them have outstanding territorial claims.
   Trouble already has been reported between ethnic Germans and
Russians in several cities on the Volga. Residents of the Saratov
and Volgograd regions have protested the prospect of seeing many of
the nation's estimated 2 million Germans descending on them.
   Ethnographers estimate there are some 500,000 Crimean Tatars in
the Soviet Union, and another 1 million in Turkey. Their protests
near the Kremlin in 1987 demanding to be allowed to return to their
homeland were among the first tests of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's promises of greater democracy.
   Several thousand Tatars have been filtering back to the Crimea
each year despite the lack of wholesale permission to return.
   A wave of some 100,000 ethnic Germans emigrated to West Germany
this year, but many would probably stay if they could be assured of
their own republic, said Irina Ostroukh, a researcher at the Soviet
Institute of Ethnography who studies ethnic Germans.
   The Nov. 28 plan approved by the Supreme Soviet recommended
excluding from the German region areas where resistance to German
resettlement was strongest in order to avoid ethnic conflicts.
   The explosive conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis over
the Nagorno-Karabakh region has led to 200 deaths and hundreds of
thousands of refugees in the last two years. Both sides claim
control over the mountainous enclave.
   The Supreme Soviet charged the government with creating a
commmission to determine how to create the regions for the Germans
and Crimean Tatars.
