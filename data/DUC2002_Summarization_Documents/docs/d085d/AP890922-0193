   Sept. 11 _ Forecasters monitor new tropical wave forming off West
Africa, southwest of the Cape Verde Islands.
   Sept. 12 _ Storm reaches the 39 mph tropical storm threshold and
is named Hugo.
   Sept. 13 _ Hugo develops into a hurricane as winds reach 74 mph.
Storm is about 1,000 miles east of the Lesser Antilles island chain.
   Sept. 14 _ Winds increase to 115 mph; storm is 650 miles east of
Lesser Antilles.
   Sept. 15 _ Winds reach 150 mph. Storm, designated a Category 4
hurricane, is considered ``extremely dangerous.'' Located 340 east
miles of French territorial island of Guadeloupe.
   Sept. 16 _ Hugo bears down on Guadeloupe and Dominica with winds
reaching 140 mph.
   Sept. 17 _ Eye of Hugo is directly over Guadeloupe. Guadeloupe is
devasted by winds measuring up to 150 mph. Five people are reported
killed, 84 injured and more than 15,000 homeless on the island of
340,000 people. Roofs were torn off, power lines downed and crops
damaged.
   Sept. 17 _ Hugo hits British island of Montserrat. Nine people
are killed and hundreds of buildings are flattened. The British
government says nearly all of the 12,000 island residents are
homeless.
   Sept. 17 _ On Antigua, two people are killed and there is
widespread wind and rain damage. Island hotels report water and wind
damage.
   Sept. 17 _ No casualties are reported on the island of St. Kitts,
but houses are damaged and communications nearly severed.
   Sept. 17 _ On the British Virgin Islands, trees are uprooted and
power and communications knocked out. On the resort island of
Tortola, residents say there are numerous injuries and scores of
homes destroyed.
   In the U.S. Virgin Islands, the popular tourist islands of St.
Croix and St. Thomas are hard hit. At least one person is reported
killed on St. Croix. Early reports say 97 percent of the buildings
were damaged or destroyed on St. Croix, population 53,000. Sailboats
were blown out of the water and thrown up to 150 feet on shore in
St. Thomas. Some waterfront businesses disappeared. On St. Croix,
widespread looting is reported, including raids by machete-wielding
gangs. Some reports say prisoners escaped from jail and were roaming
free and National Guardsman and police were joining in the looting.
   Sept. 18 (daybreak) _ Hugo crosses the northeast corner of Puerto
Rico. Damage is estimated at hundreds of millions of dollars and
homes of at least 50,000 people were destroyed or damaged. At least
three people are killed. National Guardsmen were aiding the cleanup
and trying to stop widespread looting. The Pentagon said some of its
facilities, including U.S. Naval Station at Roosevelts Roads in
Puerto Rico, were heavily damaged.
   Sept. 19 _ On the Bahamas, islanders boarded up homes and stocked
up as Hugo moved westward. The storm brushes past the islands, with
minimal damage, moving on a course parallel to the islands.
   Sept. 20 _ Headed toward the southeast coast of the United
States, Hugo has winds of 105-125 mph.
   Sept. 21 _ Hugo picks up speed and power. Winds reach 135 mph.
Hurricane is again classified as a Category 4 hurricane, capable of
extreme damage.
   Sept. 21 (midnight) _ Hugo crashes into Charleston, S.C., with
winds of 135 mph, leveling buildings and flooding streets. In
addition to flooding, fires from natural gas leaks erupt in
Charleston. Several other coastal communities also suffer heavy
damage. Ten people in the Carolinas are killed.
   Sept. 22 _ The hurricane, with steadily diminishing winds,
continues to move inland and is downgraded to a tropical storm.
Further weakening is expected as it moves north with its load of
heavy rain.
   Sept. 22 _ Hugo was downgraded to a tropical storm at 6 a.m.
Friday. Twelve hours later it had all but lost the characteristics
of a tropical storm and was weakening, although the weather system
featured maximum sustained winds of 40 mph and torrential rains. Its
last location was just west of Pittsburgh, Pa., at latitude 40.5
degrees north and longitude 81 degrees west. Officials said no
further tracking would be done.
