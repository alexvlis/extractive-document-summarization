   The ``greenhouse effect'' may breed bigger and
deadlier hurricanes in the future, storms up to 50 percent stronger
than Hugo and last year's record-setting Gilbert, some
meteorologists say.
   Hugo blasted the eastern Caribbean and the Carolinas with 135 mph
winds this past week, killing at least 41 people.
   Just before Hugo struck the U.S. coast, its pressure was measured
at 940 millibars. That made it among the 12 strongest hurricanes
this century to hit the United States, the National Hurricane
Center's Miles Lawrence said today.
   Gilbert, whose winds reached 180 mph, tore up the Caribbean last
year, killing 300 and causing $2 billion damage. It was the most
powerful hurricane ever recorded.
   Gilbert seems to be about the upper limit of a hurricane with
current ocean temperatures, said Kerry Emanuel of the meteorology
department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   But if the seas warm up, say by 3 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit, ``the
wind speeds might be 25 percent higher _ which means the destructive
force would be more like 50 percent higher,'' he said.
   Stephen Schneider, deputy director of the National Center for
Atmospheric Research in Denver, said his research suggests the
warming trend is already here.
   Schneider, an expert on the greenhouse effect and author of a new
book ``Global Warming,'' said six of the 10 hottest years in the
last 100 occurred in the 1980s.
   He projects that the 1990s will be even hotter.
   Hugo demonstrated the effect of warm Atlantic waters when its
winds jumped from 105 mph to 135 mph as it passed over the Gulf
Stream before hitting the East Coast, Schneider said.
   ``You'll get worse hurricanes if the Caribbean is warmer,'' he
said. ``And I think there are better-than-even odds that you will
have stronger hurricanes.''
   Emanuel said if the ocean temperature climbs, moderate hurricanes
of the future could grow to Gilbert's strength _ and future Gilberts
will be even stronger.
   Gilbert was so strong that Bob Sheets, director of the national
hurricane center, said forecasters may have to use an intensity
scale of 1-6 in the future, instead of the current 1-5, with five
the highest.
   The computer models Schneider uses show that in a worst-case
scenario, over the next 100 years the world's temperature could jump
by 10 degrees if carbon dioxide and methane gas _ which both
contribute to the greenhouse effect _ continue to pour into the
atmosphere unchecked.
   It is possible that even though the world as a whole heats up,
the Caribbean could somehow remain cooler. But he said that is
unlikley.
   ``That's not what the models are showing,'' Schneider said. ``And
that's another reason I'd like to slow down global warming.''
