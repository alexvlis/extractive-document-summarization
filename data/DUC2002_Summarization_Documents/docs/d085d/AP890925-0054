   Residents took forecasters at their word
when they warned of Hurricane Hugo's fury, and the low number of
deaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthy
respect, authorities said.
   The storm, which caused billions in damage, claimed 17 lives in
South Carolina, and only two were in the Charleston area, which
bore the brunt of Hugo's 135 mph winds.
   ``We just feel very thankful about that,'' said Mayor Joseph P.
Riley Jr. ``Several thousands of people who were in the shelters
and the tens of thousands of people who evacuated inland were
potential victims of injury and death.''
   Riley and other officials credited residents with monitoring the
hurricane as it spun toward Charleston, and heeding evacuation
warnings.
   The last big storm to hit South Carolina was Hurricane David in
1979, which hit the coast after pounding southern Florida.
   Since then several big storms have threatened but veered away,
and officials were worried that Charlestonians wouldn't heed Hugo's
warnings.
   ``We've had so many close calls,'' said Gary Garnet, a
meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
   ``But this storm was very, very strong,'' he said. ``This time
they realized it.''
   Glen Ellis, a Red Cross official, estimated that 18,000
residents in Charleston and the three surrounding counties headed
for shelters.
   Tens of thousands more got into their cars and headed up
Interstate 26 toward Columbia.
   Mayor John Bourne of North Charleston, where there apparently
were no storm-related deaths, credited people for heeding the
warnings.
   ``It was bad, but it could have been a lot worse,'' he said.
``You've just got to say nice things about the people.''
   Meanwhile, Garnet had some good news for storm-weary
Charlestonians: late Saturday the tropics were quiet with no other
storms brewing.
   ``There's nothing to worry about out there,'' he said.
