<LEADPARA>  Thousands of Americans piled into cars and buses with dogs, cats and duffel
bags and left Clark Air Base today after scientists warned that the eruption
of a nearby volcano could turn catastrophic.;    The decision to evacuate one
of the largest overseas U.S. military bases was made early today after searing
gases, ash and rock shot out of 4,795-foot Mount Pinatubo on Sunday at speeds
of up to 60 mph.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The volcano, about 10 miles west of the air base, came to life last week
after six centuries of dormancy. No casualties have been reported, but experts
are concerned that a major eruption could occur soon.;    Gases, ash and
molten rock continued to pour out of the mountain today, enshrouding it in
thick, gray clouds of ash and steam that rose 12,000 feet.;    The Philippine
Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology said it detected rhythmic ground
movements today that indicated molten material was rising to the surface of
the craters.;    Institute Director Raymundo Punongbayan said Mount Pinatubo
was in the "early eruptive stage" and "after that we will have bigger ones."; 
  He said most of the ash and molten rocks had been flowing westward away from
Clark. But he said geological studies showed that in the previous eruption 600
years ago, the main flow cut across what is now the western portion of Clark.;
   Rains fell across the area Sunday night, and officials warned residents in
the lush, green lowlands west of the mountain to move to higher ground to
escape mud flows.;    Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Ron Rand announced the
evacuation in a 5 a.m. broadcast over the U.S. military's Far East Network. An
hour later, the first vehicles began rolling out of Clark for the U.S.-run
Subic Bay naval base, where the 14,500 troops, dependents and civilian
employees will be housed until the danger passes. Another 1,500 troops
remained at Clark to provide security.;    The Clark command center operated
with a skeletal crew, but the base's operations were suspended. The base is a
major terminal for the worldwide network of flights operated by the Military
Airlift Command.;    The miles-long convoy jammed the two-lane roads leading
to Subic, about 50 miles southwest of Clark. U.S. Marines patrolled the
highways, which pass through areas where Communist guerrillas operate, and
U.S. helicopters hovered overhead.;    By late afternoon, U.S. officials said
all the evacuees had reached Subic.;    "If it's going to blow, I hope it does
it fast so I can go home before the cockroaches take my house," said Staff
Sgt. Mike Huffman.;    Clark Air Base is in Angeles, a city of more than
300,000 people about 50 miles north of Manila. In Angeles, residents reported
no ash fell today but said the air smelled of sulfur.;    In southern Japan
today, Mount Unzen continued to shake and spew hot ash and rocks, and heavy
rain was falling on the tons of ash and rock it disgorged over the past week,
raising fears of deadly mudslides.;    Areas around the 4,452-foot volcano
covered by evacuation warnings were expanded to protect people against
possible slides of volcanic debris that could be triggered by the rain, police
said.;    An explosion of superheated gas, ashes and rocks from the mountain
one week ago claimed 38 lives, and a larger flow over the weekend razed dozens
more homes. In all, about 9,800 people have been evacuated from communities at
the foot of the mountain, said police in Nagasaki, 30 miles away.;    Mount
Unzen and Mount Pinatubo belong to the "Ring of Fire" that circles the Pacific
where shifting plates of the Earth's crust push against each other, triggering
periodic volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.;    In the Philippines, officials
have evacuated more than 12,000 people in three provinces since Mount Pinatubo
began erupting last week. About 3,100 of them are primitive Aeta tribes people
who lived on Pinatubo's slopes.;    Many of them walked or traveled by ox cart
to flee the volcano. But reporters found that some evacuees are returning to
their homes each morning to tend to livestock and crops and heading back to
evacuation centers at sundown.;    Punongbayan said he flew to the area and
warned people there would be no time to escape once a major eruption begins.; 
  There was no indication how long the Americans evacuated from Clark would
stay at Subic, but they were ordered to take along important papers and food,
water and clothing for three days.;    Subic base spokesman Bob Coble said
families at the naval installation had been asked to take in evacuees and that
others would double up in bachelor officer and enlisted quarters.;    Mount
Pinatubo, which last had a major eruption in 1380, began to show signs of
activity in April. Last week, it belched small amounts of steam and ash.;   
There are about 21 active and 200 dormant volcanoes in the Philippines. The
last major eruption occurred in 1965, when the Taal volcano, about 50 miles
south of Manila, exploded. About 200 people were killed.  </TEXT>
