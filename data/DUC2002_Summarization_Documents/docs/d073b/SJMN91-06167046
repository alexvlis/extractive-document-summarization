<DESCRIPT>  PHILIPPINES; VOLCANO  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Mount Pinatubo rumbled today with explosions that hurled ash and gas more than
12 miles high, and a typhoon brought heavy rain that could unleash tons of
debris from the jagged slopes.;    Seven explosions were recorded from the
4,800-foot tropical volcano today, and scientists said more were expected.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Typhoon Yunya, packing 80 mph winds, slammed into the eastern coast of
Luzon island, which includes Mount Pinatubo, early in the day. But it quickly
weakened to a tropical storm with 60 mph winds by the time it was centered
about 70 miles east of the volcano.;    Still, heavy rains churned up by the
typhoon drenched Manila and the provinces near the volcano, raising fears of
mudflows that could bury whole towns up to 25 miles away.;    Meanwhile,
President Corazon Aquino dismissed a British newspaper report that Americans
had warned her of possible radioactive contamination if the volcano damages
nuclear storage sites at Clark Air Base, abandoned Monday by nearly 15,000
Americans.;    The U.S. military began flying home hundreds of the 28,000
Americans who crowded onto Subic Bay Naval Base as a bizarre tropical blizzard
of thick volcanic ash caused power failures across the base Friday during a
third day of increasingly violent eruptions of Mount Pinatubo.;    Showers of
'mud drops';  "It looks like it's snowing outside," said military spokeswoman
Capt. Kim Urie. Headlights and street lamps were turned on at midafternoon as
a "dark, black cloud" passed over the giant Navy base and dropped a gritty
rain of "mud drops," she said.;    At least four people have died, 24 have
been hurt and four have been listed as missing since Pinatubo began erupting
Sunday, after lying dormant for six centuries, officials said. About 84,000
people, including Americans, have been evacuated.;    Police said 12 people
had been arrested for looting at Clark.;    Five explosions shook the mountain
early today, showering ash over a wide area and providing a spectacular
pre-dawn display of nature's fireworks against a backdrop of lightning and
rain.;    Friday, eight thunderous explosions shot a cloud of ash and steam
nearly 19 miles high.;    Friday's eruptions hurled ash over Clark, 10 miles
east of the volcano, and Subic, 25 miles southwest, where the Clark personnel
had been temporarily housed. Gray ash also fell in Manila, 60 miles south.;   
At Subic, base spokesman Robert Coble said generators had to be shut down from
time to time to clean out volcanic ash, plunging the base into darkness.;   
River temperatures rising;  Temperatures in local rivers were rising because
of the volcanic debris, officials said.;    After sunset, the volcano spewed
two streams of orange, glowing material from its crater in what scientists
thought was the first appearance of lava during the weeklong eruptions.;   
Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and
Seismology, said Friday's blasts were part of a single eruption, the largest
since Mount Pinatubo awoke Sunday from its 600-year slumber.;    A British
newspaper, the Guardian, reported Thursday that the Americans declared a
nuclear alert at Clark late Wednesday and informed governments in Manila and
Hong Kong that "a nuclear accident in the region was possible." But Aquino
told reporters the story was "baseless and purely fabricated.";    The United
States refuses to confirm or deny that it stores nuclear weapons in the
Philippines.;    Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus also said the eruption
should have no effect on talks on the future of Clark and Subic, where leases
expire Sept. 16. The talks are deadlocked over compensation and the duration
of a new agreement.;    Punongbayan said Mount Pinatubo could remain active
for years if it follows the pattern of similar Philippine volcanoes. That
would leave Clark unusable.  </TEXT>
