<LEADPARA>  Three major new eruptions rocked Mount Pinatubo late Wednesday night and early
today, forcing another emergency evacuation of Clark Air Base and increasing
fears of even more violent explosions from the long-dormant volcano in the
days ahead.;    Mudslides also threatened after fierce thunderstorms and
lightning Wednesday illuminated afternoon skies eerily darkened by giant
volcanic clouds. As much as two inches of coarse gray ash and fist-sized
pieces of pumice fell along a 50-mile stretch southwest of the volcano.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     An eruption this morning caused an earthquake so strong it "sent
seismograph needles off the chart," and registered 60 miles south in Manila,
said Jessie Daligdig, a government geologist.;    Villagers tied wet kerchiefs
on their faces and used rakes, shovels and pieces of wood to push the blanket
of snow-like ash from roads. At times, winds whipped the grit into the air,
forcing cars to use windshield wipers and headlights in blizzard-like
conditions through the afternoon.;    Two people have been reported killed so
far, a Filipino serving in the U.S. Navy who died in a traffic accident on an
ash-slick road and a Filipino boy reported to have died after inhaling
sulfuric fumes that began to seep from the volcano last weekend.;    The
initial explosions on Mount Pinatubo at 8:51 a.m. Wednesday sent a
10-mile-high mushroom cloud of swirling ash and rock fragments into the skies
over Clark Air Base, forcing the Air Force to evacuate hundreds of American
volunteers who had stayed behind to guard it and to tend sensitive
communications equipment.;    Most of the 16,000 Americans who live and work
at Clark were evacuated Monday, when scientists said it was clear that the
volcano, dormant for more than six centuries, was returning to life.;    U.S.
officials have refused to say whether nuclear weapons are stored at Clark, but
they denied news reports suggesting a radiation danger if weapons depots on
the base were hit by molten rock.;    Many of the villages in the vicinity
were holding Independence Day celebrations when heavy gray clouds first began
raining ash Wednesday morning. The mayor in San Marcelino, 17 miles southwest
of the volcano, was giving a speech to several thousand people when dark
clouds suddenly blotted the sun and turned day to night.;    Calixto Macalma
Jr., a police intelligence officer, said people panicked as it began "raining
sand." Church bells pealed in alarm, sirens wailed and many ran for shelter.; 
  Philippine civil defense officials said that they had evacuated 19,369
people from villages within a 12-mile radius of the volcano by late Wednesday.
Along the roads, some people wore cardboard boxes on their heads for
protection; some rode their water buffaloes to safety.;    At least 330
villagers, who had ignored earlier warnings to flee Aglao hamlet, finally
abandoned their homes Wednesday afternoon.;    "There were big stones, like
this," said one woman who escaped, holding out her fists. "We are very
scared.";    Thousands of residents of Angeles City, east of the volcano,
initially fled in panic from the booming morning blasts and greenish-gray
mushroom cloud that towered over the area. Passenger jeeps sped through the
streets, refusing to stop for riders as the drivers drove for cover. Most
residents later returned to the sprawling city.;    But officials issued no
general evacuation order for Angeles, even though the city is next to Clark
Air Base. U.S. geologists advising the Philippine government said most of
Angeles was not at risk, apparently basing their assessment on earth samples
indicating that earlier eruptions had reached the area on which Clark now
stands but had spared what is now Angeles.;    President Corazon Aquino
helicoptered to refugee centers near Angeles briefly before returning to
Manila for an Independence Day rally and parade at Luneta Park. She authorized
the release of $1.42 million for relief efforts.;    Raymundo Punongbayan,
director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, said
scientists could not estimate how much magma was still pent up inside Mount
Pinatubo, but said more eruptions at least as violent are expected within the
next three days.;    "All we can do is wait," he said. "The crisis is not
over."  </TEXT>
