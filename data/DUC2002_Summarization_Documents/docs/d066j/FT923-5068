MADE IN AMERICA: MY STORY
By Sam Walton
Doubleday, Dollars 22.50. 269 pages
Being an American folk hero is a tricky assignment, as Ross Perot found out.
The problem is that the great American public likes its boot-strap
entrepreneurs to be very rich and very upright. In a country where business
practices are not overly genteel, this is a tough combination to achieve. A
vast media circus, meanwhile, is quick to expose any flaws.
Sam Walton, founder of the Wal-Mart chain of discount supermarkets who died
of cancer in April, negotiated these pitfalls much better than most. When,
in 1985, Forbes magazine declared him America's richest entrepreneur, the
paparazzi descended on the obscure corner of Arkansas, mainly occupied by
chicken farmers, where Walton made his home. What they found was a happily
married, much-liked billionaire who enjoyed quail hunting, breakfasted at
the local Holiday Inn, and drove a battered pick-up truck, minus two
hub-caps. Folksy was an understatement.
Since then, some aspects of Wal-Mart's business - its anti-union policies,
the impact of its Dollars 40bn annual sales on hundreds of Mom-and-Pop shops
 -have been subject to critical scrutiny. So, to an extent, have the less
wholesome adventures of the four Walton children. But no one has ever been
able to make Sam himself look bad. The worst that has been said is that he
was rather dull.
Walton is not about to dash anyone's illusions. Readers will either find his
autobiography lashed with 'good ol'' common-sense and a lot of harmless, if
charming, anecdotes. Or they will find it dreary and downbeat. Walton makes
no excuses: 'I realise this may sound boring to most you,' he writes at one
stage, 'but one of my best items ever was a mattress pad called a Bedmate .
. . .'
A few snippets are more revealing about the character. There cannot be many
billionaires who admit that they 'never learned handwriting too well' - and
have the guts to include a photograph which demonstrates the point.
Meanwhile, the competitive energy which Sam Walton applied to his business
is inescapable. In one of many contributions from friends and family, Don
Soderquist, Wal-Mart's chief operating officer, tells of finding Sam one
Saturday morning on his hand and knees at the local Kmart store, analysing
his rival's stock. And his wife, in a casual aside, notes that when the
couple was on holiday in Italy their luggage vanished while her husband was
off on a similar scouting mission.
But it is David Glass, Wal-Mart's current chief executive, who perhaps
captures the entrepreneurial Walton spirit best. Explaining the annual
contest in which Wal-Mart executives choose one 'volume producing item' to
promote, he recalls the time Sam (who usually won) selected minnow buckets
for carrying bait. Glass was more happily teamed with apple juice. 'So I
would go down to the stores, and get them to take that minnow bucket . . .
put ice in it, ice down the juice and give away samples out of his minnow
bucket. I particularly did it in stores I knew (Sam) was going to visit. It
drove him crazy, and he got off that minnow bucket pretty quick . . . .'
But the reader can't help feeling that the cosy yarns tell only half the
truth. Sam Walton was a salesman to the core, and seems to have packaged
himself with all the skill that he once applied to selling a gooey southern
sweet called Moon Pies.
For the most part, this makes for an engaging, if one-dimensional, portrait.
Occasionally, it just grates. 'I had bought a bank in Bentonville, for about
about Dollars 300,000,' Walton remarks, for example, 'just a little old bank
with only about Dollars 3.5m in deposits. But it helped me learn a lot about
financing things.' Oh, come on Sam, is that the whole story?
The real truth, one suspects, comes right at the end of the book - when
Walton admits that 'if I hadn't gotten sick, I doubt I would have written
this book'. Given the pleadings of publishers - Doubleday paid about Dollars
4m for the manuscript - and a rather natural desire to have a final say, he
can hardly be blamed for agreeing to write it. But these are unlikely to be
circumstances which make for the most critical self-analysis. At the end of
the day, Sam Walton's heritage is in the shopping malls, not the bookstores.
