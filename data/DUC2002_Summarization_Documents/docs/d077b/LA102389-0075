</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although they are a continent apart, the cities of Charleston, S.C., and San 
Francisco now share a fateful page in the ledger of time. They are the scenes 
of two of the century's costliest, back-to-back natural disasters: Hurricane 
Hugo and the Bay Area earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
There are dramatic similarities and profound differences in the ways these two 
cities were affected and altered in the first week after they were ravaged by 
two powerful forces of nature -- one that angrily swept across the land from 
the sea and one that violently rumbled beneath the earth. 
</P>
<P>
"From the standpoint of compassion, of all the people in America we can feel 
the hurt that the San Francisco area is going through the most," Charleston 
Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said Sunday, one month after Hugo hit. "We know it 
means, at best, the disruption of normal life for some time and, at worst, the 
loss of life." 
</P>
<P>
Charleston had warning. San Francisco did not. Unlike earthquakes, hurricanes 
can be tracked by planes and radar, their paths predicted with sufficient 
certainty for those in harm's way to secure property and to flee. Still, at 
least 28 deaths in the Carolinas are blamed on Hugo, while at least 60 deaths 
have been attributed to the Bay Area earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Hugo, 500 miles across with winds topping 175 m.p.h., left virtually every 
street and every neighborhood littered with storm debris and 80% of the city's 
buildings with some degree of damage. Five days after the storm, many city 
residents remained inconvenienced, most without electricity, many without safe 
drinking water. Street lights didn't work. Broken glass and other debris left 
the roadsides lined with cars stopped by flat tires. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast the streets in most of San Francisco were passable within a day of 
the earthquake. Electricity was largely restored overnight. And most broken 
natural gas lines were quickly repaired. Restaurants in Chinatown, North Beach 
and along Fillmore Street were crowded Saturday night. Cable cars began 
carrying passengers Sunday and the curtain went up on the opera. 
</P>
<P>
"Their streets were immediately passable," said Charleston Police Chief Ruben 
Greenberg. "We were gridlocked for two days because of the debris." 
</P>
<P>
And a week after the hurricane, Charleston -- which like San Francisco has a 
tourism-based economy -- was still trying to cope with mountains of broken 
trees and shattered roofs. It was more than 10 days before restaurants and 
other stores began to slowly reopen and twice as long for night life to begin 
to return. 
</P>
<P>
Tour Buses Return 
</P>
<P>
By Sunday, tourists and tour buses could be seen outside hotels near 
Fisherman's Wharf and at other locations favored by visitors. Tourism is a 
$2.5-billion-a-year business in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
It took almost three weeks for businesses that cater to tourists to get back on 
their feet in Charleston. It's likely to take a lot longer for the tourists 
themselves to return in numbers that made it one of the city's biggest 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
Citywide, Charleston had 68 buildings collapse, compared to 60 buildings 
destroyed just in San Francisco's Marina District. 
</P>
<P>
In Charleston most of the damage could be quickly assessed. It was visible. In 
San Francisco much of the damage may still be undetected. Water mains and gas 
lines weakened by the heaving earth may not break for weeks or months. 
Structural damage to houses, in many instances, will become apparent over a 
long period of time. 
</P>
<P>
"When a hurricane is over, it's over," Greenberg said. "Not so with an 
earthquake. You have aftershocks." 
</P>
<P>
Charleston also escaped widespread damage to its infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost no major economic area like the Bay Bridge," said Greenberg, who was 
once San Francisco's undersheriff and who returned with emergency supplies to 
help the Santa Cruz police. "That's an economic lifeline. All we lost was one 
minor bridge. They're going to have humongous traffic problems." 
</P>
<P>
Hugo left Charleston isolated from the world. Communications broke down soon 
after the storm crossed the coastline about midnight and it was daybreak before 
the nation began to learn of the widespread damage. Even local residents were 
left without any information. The hurricane knocked out all local television 
and radio stations, and local officials for almost two days depended on a 
Florida radio station to deliver vital information and warnings. 
</P>
<P>
Millions were watching the pregame World Series program when the earthquake 
struck, and instantly word was out that there had been a disaster. San 
Francisco stations were able to broadcast to residents who had battery-powered 
radios and TVs. 
</P>
<P>
Damage estimates from Hugo have ranged as high as $5 billion, while earthquake 
damage estimates Sunday reached the $6.6 billion mark. 
</P>
<P>
Besides that black page in the ledger of history, both San Francisco and 
Charleston also have another experience in common: Both have experienced 
frustrating delays in getting disaster relief from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg, who has now watched the federal government respond to two of 
America's worst disasters, said he sees relatively few differences between how 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency worked in South Carolina and Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing that needs to be done in a hurry with them," he said. "They 
just plop along like one of the horses at Disneyland. Just plop, plop, plop. 
They are repeating the mistakes of South Carolina in California."
