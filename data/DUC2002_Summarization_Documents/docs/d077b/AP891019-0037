   Private groups and officials from Tokyo to London to Charleston,
S.C., offered help to the ruptured San Francisco Bay area, but some
said relief for the earthquake could drain coffers already strained
by previous disasters.
   Los Angeles, long San Francisco's West Coast competitor but
equally at the mercy of the San Andreas Fault, quickly shipped
doctors, sonic equipment and fire investigators to the Bay Area.
   The mayor of a sister city in disaster, Charleston's Joseph P.
Riley Jr., sent a plane load of drinking water, a symbolic return
of the support his city got after Hugo.
   ``I know we still have and will have great needs here and
charity certainly begins at home,'' Riley said. ``However, it would
be wrong for this community ... not to reach in (our pockets) and
contribute to those who are hurt and suffering right now.''
   San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos has estimated damage $2 billion in
his city alone.
   The Salvation Army had the food cooking almost before the earth
quit shaking in Northern California, while the Red Cross opened the
doors and unfolded cots in 25 shelters.
   ``We don't wait for anybody,'' said Col. Leon Ferraez,
communications director of the Salvation Army. ``We're there the
minute the news is on.''
   According to Ferraez, the organization dispatched 12 mobile
canteens to the hardest-hit earthquake areas within minutes. All
Salvation Army centers in the Bay Area, including 34 community
service centers and scores of other units, have been turned over to
the relief effort.
   Los Angeles donated sonic equipment to help detect sounds of
people trapped in rubble. And officials in Los Alamos, N.M.,
dispatched a device used to locate survivors of last year's
Armenian quake.
   Israel offered the services of a special army rescue squad that
also helped dig out victims in Armenia. A French disaster relief
agency offered to send special teams of searchers.
   A team of British engineers were to fly to San Francisco today
to help assess structural damage from the quake.
   The Bay Area has a large Asian population, and callers from
Japan and the Philippines and other countries jammed phone lines
trying to reach relatives.
   The Osaka, Japan, city government announced it was sending
$10,000 to San Francisco, a sister city since 1957.
   Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley sent police and fire investigators
to assess damage from the quake, and convened his own emergency
council in a special meeting to discuss other possible measures.
   ``I am joining millions of Californians as we intensely watch
the damage of the large San Francisco earthquake,'' said Bradley.
``We all know the horrors of an earthquake and we express our
deep-felt sympathy for the people of the San Francisco Bay area.''
   An Anheuser-Busch Inc. brewery in Fairfield, 35 miles northeast
of San Francisco, interrupted normal operations to fill cans with
drinking water instead of beer for free shipment to relief
agencies, the company said.
   Coast Guard offices across the West Coast provided San Francisco
with as many boats and helicopters as could be spared, said Coast
Guard spokeswoman Elizabeth Neely.
   The Red Cross sent 290 units of blood from Los Angeles; the San
Diego Blood Bank rushed 50 units to San Francisco within an hour of
the quake; more than 400 units were sent from Portland, Ore.
   ``Giving makes them feel good,'' said Trudy Sullivan, a Red
Cross spokeswoman in Portland.
   Even the Internal Revenue Service got into the act, announcing
it would waive penalties for taxpayers unable to file returns or
make scheduled payments because of the earthquake.
   President Bush directed $273 million in immediate aid for quake
victims and said he would visit the area Friday or Saturday.
   But some officials said the disaster could strain the coffers of
private agencies and those of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, which was criticized for its response to the storm-lashed
Carolinas.
   The Red Cross began its fiscal year July 1 with $18.5 million in
its disaster budget, and had spent 40 percent by September. Then
Hugo came along, triggering an effort the agency estimates will
cost $42 million _ the most ever.
   ``When a major earthquake and a major hurricane hit
back-to-back, you can bet it will stretch Red Cross disaster
resources and manpower,'' said Bob Vessey, director of disaster
services in Washington, D.C.
