   The Berlin villa where the Nazi leadership met
to implement the ``final solution'' against Europe's Jewish
population will be the site of a World Jewish Congress conference
on German reunification.
   The New York-based organization announced Tuesday that the
meeting is scheduled for May 8, the 45th anniversary of V-E Day.
   ``The world is expecting a Jewish statement on reunification,''
said Edgar Bronfman, the president of the World Jewish Congress.
   ``I think that the place where they decided on the `final
solution' is the right place to have such a meeting, and the
anniversary of the victory in Europe seems to be the right day.''
   Some 100 members of the World Jewish Congress from about 70
countries will attend the conference at the villa in Wannsee,
Berlin, where on Jan. 20, 1942, high German government and party
officials adopted a plan to exterminate the Jews.
   ``Jews have a right to state a moral position on German
reunification and we will make a moral statement. And part of that
moral statement is to see that it (the Holocaust) doesn't happen
again,'' Bronfman said.
   In the long run, he said, a united Germany can be ``a very
positive thing'' for Europe, but certain precautions must be taken
to prevent a repeat of history. For example, Germany's borders
``must be sealed in cement,'' and the country should not be allowed
nuclear weapons, he said.
   Bronfman said he does not fear a resurgence of anti-Semitism
once the two Germanys are united. In fact, he said, reunification
might cause a decline in anti-Jewish feelings.
   ``Now that reunification is about to be a fact, they won't be
blaming the Jews'' for a divided Germany, Bronfman explained.
   The conference will convene May 6 and a formal declaration on
German reunification will be issued May 8. It will be the first
meeting ever held on German soil by the World Jewish Congress,
which was founded in 1936 in response to Hitler's threats against
Jews.
