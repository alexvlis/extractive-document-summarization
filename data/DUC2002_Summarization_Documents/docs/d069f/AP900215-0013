   Historians say the world need not fear that
German jackboots will echo again on European pavements, but some
still see the rush toward German reunification as a setback _ a
step away from the integration of Europe.
   For the most part, the historians say an East Germany collapsing
into chaos represents a greater threat to stability than a united
German state.
   ``The West Germans are moving ahead not out of nationalistic
fervor, but a perceived need to deal with a crisis,'' said Henry
Ashby Turner of Yale, author of ``The Two Germanies Since 1945.''
   ``There is no such a thing as indelible national character,''
Turner said. ``I don't think there is any chance that the young men
of Germany are going to slip out of their Adidas running shoes and
pull on jackboots and start running around saying, `Heil!''
   He was one of several experts in German history discussing the
implications of reunification following the decision Tuesday by the
four World War II allies _ the United States, Britain, France and
the Soviet Union _ to accept the reunification of a Germany they
divided 45 years ago.
   University of Chicago historian Michael Geyer, a native of
Germany, said he feared the creation of a ``strong, sovereign
nation in the center of Europe'' could reverse a more important
development _ the 40-year drive toward an integrated Europe in
which industries, banks, trade unions and even government
ministries have been collaborating across borders.
   ``The East German state is collapsing,'' said Geyer. ``So
something has to happen very dramatically. But they have a choice _
the Europeans and Germans and Americans. Do they want to opt for
the European card or for the German card? I think they are opting
for the German card.''
   ``I hear these days very little about what Gorbachev called `the
house of Europe,''' he said.
   The result of a dominant ``uncomfortably strong'' German state,
Geyer added, could be a setback to the diminishment of national
borders. It could also mean, he said, that American troops might
have to stay in Europe as a counterweight to Germany.
   ``If I had my druthers reunifications would have happened after
1992, after the integration of the West German economy into the
economy of Western Europe,'' said Charles J. Herber of George
Washington University, expressing similar concern.
   ``Then there would have been fewer chances for German
adventurers,'' he said.
   West Germans were aware of their European neighbors' misgivings,
said Richard Breitman of American University, and so they presented
reunification within the context of European integration. They
wanted to avoid arousing fear of a united Germany again dominating
Europe.
   ``Even if the history did not exist, there would be fears of
that kind,'' he said. ``We're dealing not just with rational
calculation but a whole host of emotional memories.''
   For all that, Breitman said, ``One Germany is not only
inevitable, but given the successful record of West Germany over
the last 40 years, my feeling is it is better than having a regime
in chaos.''
   ``The only alternative to reunification,'' added Turner, is an
East Germany in ruins, ``a basket case, a Bangladesh of Europe.''
   He said Germans have ``no significant interest in territorial
revisions. Those misgivings are misplaced.''
   Gerhard Weinberg of the University of North Carolina, considered
a leading historian of the Nazi era, cautioned that reunification,
if mishandled, could prove explosive.
   While the people of West Europe have gotten over nationalistic
distrusts, East Europeans, living in closed societies, have not, he
said, and fear of Germany is a reality in East Europe and Russia,
he said.
   ``I don't think the Germans are heading for Moscow again, but we
have to give people _ and the Germans have to give people _ time to
think this through and get used to it. ... Mishandled,
reunification could scare one or the other of the participants into
starting something and scare others and goodness knows where it
would end.''
   Gordon Craig, emeritus professor at Stanford, said the division
of Germany has been the basis of a peace settlement ``which worked
pretty well'' but was ``abnormal and sooner or later had to be
corrected.''
   German reunification, said Craig, gives the world the chance to
build a new international system, one that ``will prevent the use
of international violence.''
   He added, ``We have to be careful that we don't fall back into
the kind of system that existed before the Second World War, a
Europe filled with nations that were suffering various grievances,
rivalries, disputed frontiers, driven by what they considered to be
legitimate reasons but pitted against each other _ the sort of
things that gave rise to Hitler in 1933.''
