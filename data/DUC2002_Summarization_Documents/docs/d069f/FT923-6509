FT  24 AUG 92 / Letter: The Bundesbank is led to the dock

Sir, The argument for an independent central bank is that it should be free
of party political interference, not that it should conduct monetary policy
without regard to national, regional or global interests.
Whatever policy the Kohl government followed over reunification, it was
bound to unleash a large federal deficit and inflationary pressures in
Germany. As the western German population is now aware, German reunification
needs a strong, growing west German economy to finance the subsidisation of
eastern Germans' living standards until there is a sustained upswing in the
east - even if at the cost of higher German inflation than the Bundesbank
would wish.
In Europe as a whole, very high real interest rates threaten to turn
recession into depression. The governments of Europe have been remarkably
patient with the Bundesbank, although it is threatening nearly 10 years of
European effort for greater economic and political integration. Surely there
must be compromise of some economic habits to achieve the latter?
It is ironic that, just when German reunification presented a short-term
reason for Germany to shift its anti-inflationary economic and monetary
priorities, accommodating European convergence, Bundesbank intransigence is
threatening the EMU commitment.
Beyond Europe, the dominant economic forces are strongly disinflationary.
But Germany is the one economy which, for reasons of reunification, could
afford a more relaxed stand on the inflationary front.
Yet Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, advises there are no
grounds for a cut in Germany's interest rates. This, despite the
unreliability of German money supply data.
The German government might point out to the Bundesbank that monetary
targets might be achievable only at the cost of many more than 3m unemployed
in Germany, of the destruction of the EMU programme and global depression.
A DM exchange rate adjustment within the ERM is not the answer to the
problems. We need a prolonged low-interest-rate German reunification boom.
The European currency bloc is overvalued against the dollar and yen as a
result of Bundesbank interest rate policies. And this is aggravating
recession.
A future European-wide central bank must clearly - like the US Federal
Reserve - be more accountable in the broader European political and economic
interest.
The governments and central banks of Europe and the G7 block - including the
Kohl administration - should pressurise the Bundesbank, and be prepared to
consider constitutional changes if necessary, to halt this idiocy.
