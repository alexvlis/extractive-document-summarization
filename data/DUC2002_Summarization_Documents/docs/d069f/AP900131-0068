   West German officials and media today praised
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for softening his view on
German reunification and said it could give hope to disheartened
East Germans.
   Disgraced former Communist Party leader Erich Honecker was
released from prison Tuesday night after justice officials
determined he was too frail to withstand the rigors of imprisonment
while awaiting trial on treason charges.
   Gorbachev said Tuesday in Moscow that he believed one Germany
was likely in the future, but he added that Germans ``should not
decide this important question on the streets.''
   He referred to the growing number of demonstrations in East
Germany in support of reunification.
   Gorbachev's statement was his most tolerant yet on the subject
of a single Germany, which has been opposed by Communists for more
than 40 years. East German Communists on Tuesday endorsed for
reunification for the first time.
   In West Germany, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher told
West German Radio that Gorbachev had ``correctly analyzed'' the
situation and again shown his political skill.
   West German officials and media praised Gorbachev's view as
``realistic'' and described it as an important sign of hope for
East Germans who have lost faith in their government.
   Communist leaders launched their uphill campaign for March 18
parliamentary elections with a news conference to unveil their
``European concept'' that aims for a united and demilitarized
Europe.
   Party ideologist Peter Brie said the Communists support ``the
togetherness of the German nation,'' and urged a thoughtful and
measured approach to reunification.
   In an interview with the West German Bild newspaper, party
leader Gregor Gysi complained that the reunification drive is
moving too quickly.
   Asked if the Communists oppose reunification, Gysi told the
newspaper: ``No, not at all. This process cannot be stopped any
more. But it is irresponsible to do things in such a way now as if
it were possible tomorrow.''
   The reunification issue promises to dominate the election
campaign that will seat a new leadership in less than seven weeks.
   Increasing numbers of East Germans have demonstrated for union
with wealthy and prosperous West Germany as their own economy
tumbles and an exodus of skilled workers continues unchecked.
   More than 340,000 people fled East Germany last year, having
lost hope that their spartan living conditions would improve. The
devastating flight has included as many as 2,500 people daily since
Jan. 1.
   The Communists are widely distrusted because of corruption
scandals that have surfaced since the peaceful pro-democracy revolt
last fall, and because they carry the blame for leading East
Germany into its current economic and political crises.
   The man most blamed for the country's problems, Honecker, was
set free after an East Berlin court rejected a request that he be
kept in prison until his trial in March. He was jailed Monday.
   The court decided that ``despite the severity of the charges
against Honecker, the state of the accused's health does not permit
imprisonment,'' the official ADN news agency reported.
   A spokesman for Chief Prosecutor Hans-Juergen Joseph promised
that the investigation against Honecker would proceed.
   ADN said the court acted on advice from two doctors who examined
Honecker independently. Honecker, 77, underwent surgery on Jan. 8
to remove a malignant kidney tumor.
   Honecker was ousted from the leadership on Oct. 18, after
massive pro-democracy demonstrations. He was expelled from the
Communist Party in December and has since been accused of treason
and abusing his power.
