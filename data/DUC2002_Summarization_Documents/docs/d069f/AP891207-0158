   The government on Thursday allowed for the
possibility of a reunified Germany, but said such a state must be
formed gradually and respect Poland's borders.
   In the Solidarity government's first definitive statement on the
issue, Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski told Parliament the
two German states could be joined as part of the process of uniting
Europe.
   He said German reunification ``cannot go ahead'' of the
reunification of Europe.
   ``A reunited Germany will not be created tomorrow or the day
after tomorrow,'' Skubiszewski said. ``Fears and concerns appearing
every now and then, including in Poland, are unjustified, although
alertness is recommended.''
   Asked about German reunification at a news conference in Gdansk,
Solidarity labor leader Lech Walesa said he prefers ``no political
changes in Europe, but there should be all kinds of economic
integrations.''
   Western European countries have agreed to form an economic union
by the end of 1992.
   Sweeping democratic reforms have taken hold in East Germany in
the past several weeks under the pressure of mass protests,
spurring talk of reuniting the two German states divided at the end
of World War II. West Germany has proposed a plan for greater
unity, but East German leaders reject reunification.
   The specter of a powerful, reunited Germany has troubed many
Poles, especially the older ones who recall the 1939 Nazi invasion
of Poland that began World War II.
   A reported surge in anti-Polish sentiment in East Germany in
recent weeks has heightened Polish anxieties.
   Skubiszewski's speech seemed designed to reassure Poles that the
government does not see unification in the near future and will
insist on Poland's current borders.
   Skubiszewski faulted West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
program for gradual German reunification, offered last week, for
not making clear that reunification would respect the existing
border between Poland and East Germany.
   Some right-wing West German politicians have called for
recovering the 40,000 square miles of territory that Germany lost
to Poland at the end of World War II. The territory is about
one-third of present-day Poland.
   East Germany and West Germany each separately has recognized the
border, but there has been no official assurance that a reunified
Germany would also acknowledge the border.
   ``One can only unite within established borders and without
territorial arguments,'' said Skubiszewski.
   He also said German reunification is unlikely as long as West
Germany belongs to NATO and East Germany to the Soviet-led Warsaw
Pact military alliance.
