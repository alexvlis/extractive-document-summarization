   Three decades ago, a West German
politician said German reunification was a ``sleeping lioness''
that would awake one day with a mighty roar.
   Now, there is growing speculation the awakening may be at hand
to create a giant political and economic machine that could
dominate Europe.
   ``Reunification is coming closer, but I can't say whether it
will take 10, 15 or 20 years,'' says West German conservative
lawmaker Eduard Lintner. ``We have the impression that things are
much more concrete than we could have imagined five years ago.''
   The daily sight of thousands of refugees fleeing East German
leader Erich Honecker's hard-line Communist rule for the capitalist
West has revived international interest in the debate.
   Once dismissed as a nostalgic daydream, the idea of German
reunification has gotten a public nod from President Bush and
something short of a categorical ``no'' from President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.
   The idea makes East German leaders virtually apopletic.
   ``If there were a free choice under the present circumstances in
the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), certainly 80 percent
to 90 percent would vote for national reunification with the
Federal Republic of Germany,'' added the 44-year-old Lintner in an
Associated Press interview.
   The West German constitution calls for a united Germany, but it
has not been a paramount concern of the West Germans in the years
since the ruins of Nazi Germany were divided into East and West at
the end of World War II.
   Full national reunification would completey rework the postwar
European order mapped out by the conquering Allies. It is a
prospect that creates unease in Britain and France, and in Poland
in the East bloc.
   London's prestigious Sunday Times on Sept. 10 mapped out a
possible scenario that includes massive troop reductions in Europe,
Honecker's death and further Westernization of Poland and Hungary.
   ``Moscow unilaterally abolishes the Warsaw Pact after guarantees
from Poland and Hungary they will not join other alliances,'' the
Times' futuristic view continued. ``West Germany withdraws from
NATO; and a referendum in both East and West Germany votes for
reunification and neutrality.''
   That sort of talk is being heard more and more as Moscow loosens
its hold on the East bloc and countries like the Soviet Union,
Poland and Hungary explore democratic reforms.
   The implications of pulling down the Berlin Wall and other
barriers to link the two German states are enormous and, for many,
ominous.
   As much of Western Europe heads towards its own unification in
1992, the economic center of gravity would be shifted even further
to the German side with a powerhouse of nearly 80 million people _
61.1 million West Germans and 16.6 million East Germans.
   West Germany is already Europe's largest exporting nation, and
despite its many flaws East Germany's economy is the envy of many
Soviet bloc neighbors.
   A unified Germany could become the political focal point of a
continent already in flux, as democratic movements sweep parts of
the Soviet bloc.
   Older generations recall eerie echoes of Nazi dictator Adolf
Hitler's boasting that he had brought about ``the unity of the
German nation.''
   Eva Kulesza, head of research for the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe at the French Institute of International Relations, says she
believes that ``as far as public opinion there is new sort of
mistrust toward Germany.
   ``This new fear of Germany is linked to German economic trends.
Germany is much stronger, much more dynamic than France,'' she
added.
   Since West Germany and East Germany are at the front lines of
two competing alliances, any signs for eventual reunification would
have to come from Washington and Moscow.
   During a news conference last week in Montana, Bush said that
reunification is a ``matter for the Germans to decide.''
   But he added: ``If that (reunification) was worked out between
the Germanys, I do not think we should view that as bad for Western
interests.''
   For his part, Gorbachev evaded the issue during a news
conference in Bonn in June, saying only, ``the situation in Europe
today was determined by historical realities.''
   Outside Germany, political leaders and commentators have been
sharply divided on the issue.
   ``In thinking about the German Question, we ought not to be
governed by old prejudices and out-of-date assumptions,'' wrote
commentator Peter Jenkins in London's The Independent. ``The Cold
War was conducted in the name of freedom and, today, if the coming
of freedom to East Germany brings a desire for unity which finds
its echo in the Federal Republic, we ought not to be opposed.''
   Willy Brandt, the Social Democrat who sought greater ties to the
East as chancellor in the 1970s, said German unity doesn't
necessarily mean a single state although he called reunification a
``hypothesis that cannot be excluded.''
   As talk grows in the West, the positions against reunification
almost seem to harden in East Germany, as people leave the country
in near-record numbers. More than 100,000 East Germans are expected
to resettle in West Germany this year, leaving a gaping hole in the
Communist nation's work force.
   Little is likely to change in East Germany as long as the
77-year-old Honecker and his aging comrades stay in power.
   During a September 1987 visit to Bonn, Honecker called respect
for Europe's present borders a basic condition of peace.
   ``Socialism and capitalism can't be any more united than fire
and water,'' Honecker added on the issue of reunification.
   There are virtually no indications that Honecker's successors
will be inclined to democratic reforms, let alone joining the
capitalist West.
   The calls for reunification have already found a sympathetic ear
among some leaders of the Polish Solidarity movement, in the
country that suffered some of the Nazis' most brutal savagery.
   ``After all, the abnormal situation of the German nation
overshadows the whole of Polish-German relations,'' member of
Parliament Adam Michnik wrote on Monday in the pro-Solidarity daily
newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, which he edits.
   The renewed talk of reunification is recalling the nearly
prophetic words of Reinhold Maier, a prominent West German state
governor who later went on to head the centrist Free Democratic
Party.
   ``Reunification is resting in our midst like a sleeping lioness.
Tired and weak, indecisive people in West Germany are trying not to
disturb her sleep,'' Maier predicted in 1955. ``The lioness will
one day wake up, blink, snap her her tail and start to roar.''
   Still, many in both East and West still agree with the 1967 quip
by Nobel Prize-winning French author Francois Mauriac: ``I love
Germany so much, I'm delighted that there are two of them.''
