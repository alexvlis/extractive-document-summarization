   The scarred battleship USS Iowa made a
somber return Sunday to its home port, where about 3,000 family
members and friends of the crew welcomed loved ones who escaped an
explosion that killed 47 sailors.
   Sailors in whites with black arm bands lined the rails as the
huge vessel docked at the Norfolk Naval Base's Pier 5 at 5:41 p.m.,
just one minute later than Navy officials had estimated. Twenty
minutes later, families started filing aboard the ship, exchanging
tearful embraces with the returning sailors.
   ``They wanted to get here on schedule and were anxious to get
home,'' said Capt. Steven Karalekas.
   The explosion Wednesday flashed through the Iowa's No. 2 gun
turret, which extends six decks down into the ship. There were 11
survivors inside the turret, all on the lowest deck loading powder
from the ship's magazines, the Navy said.
   Two of the surviving crewmen of No. 2 turret stood on top of the
fire-blackened turret as the ship pulled into the pier, with full
crews on the ship's two other turrets, the Navy said.
   The No. 2 turret was in the same position as when the explosion
occurred, facing right with the left and right guns elevated. The
center gun, where the blast occurred, was depressed.
   When the 887-foot vessel first appeared there were scattered
cheers by those on the dock, but all remained silent as the ship
pulled into the pier. The somber mood was heightened by the lack of
bands, and few waves were exchanged as the ship docked.
   Adm. Powell Carter, commander in chief of the Atlantic Fleet,
was on the dock to greet the vessel. As it docked, three Marines
raised a flag to half-mast at the stern of the ship.
   The Navy kept the news media about 300 yards from the families,
and reporters were not allowed to talk with the families or the
crewmen.
   The violence and power of the turret explosion was shown in an
amateur videotape released by the Navy on Sunday. The tape was made
by an officer on the bridge of the Iowa who wanted to record the
firing of the big guns.
   The detonation, which appears to blast away the gasket-like
rubber ``bloomers'' that seal the turret's gun slits, is followed
by a jet of intense fire and thick smoke from the front and base of
the gunhouse.
   The videotape cut immediately to damage control firefighters
spraying heavy streams of water onto the turret.
   Throughout the Norfolk area, churches dedicated prayers Sunday
morning to the families of Iowa crewmen.
   ``We have lost 47 of our number in a tragic way,'' said Cmdr.
John L. Fitzgerald, a chaplain, in a service at the Norfolk Naval
Air Station. ``Our faith helps us to handle what science cannot
answer, the mystery of death.''
   A red rose, a yellow ribbon with the number 47 on it and a book
containing the names of the dead were taken to the altar.
   Fitzgerald said the Iowa tragedy and that of a recently lost
Soviet submarine ``put political differences aside and unite the
human family as one.''
   On Monday morning, President Bush will lead a memorial service
in a base hangar that can accommodate 3,000 people.
   The families of the victims were invited, but Navy officials
said they did not know how many would attend. None of the victims
listed the Norfolk area as their hometown.
   The explosion occurred during exercises off Puerto Rico. The
Pentagon said it happened before the middle 16-inch gun of the
three-gun turret had been fired. The guns, the largest on any ship
at sea, use six 110-pound bags of black powder to fire a
2,700-pound projectile up to 23 miles.
   The Navy has refused to speculate on the cause of the explosion,
which damaged only the inside of the turret.
   But Navy teams who entered the turret immediately after the
blast found the No. 2 gun's breech open and undamaged, with the
practice projectile that the gun was to have fired still there, The
New York Times reported Sunday.
   This indicated the explosion occurred while the powder bags were
still being loaded into the gun, the Times said, citing
unidentified sources.
   Navy gunnery officers believe the explosion occurred when the
bags were being transferred from a powder hoist to the gun, the
newspaper said. They said flame and hot gases from the blast went
down the hoist to the lowest deck; if the transfer of powder to the
guns had been complete, the hoist would have been sealed off.
   The Iowa and its sister ships, the battleships Missouri, New
Jersey and Wisconsin, were commissioned during World War II and
mothballed after the Korean War. They were recommissioned by the
Reagan administration in the 1980s.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Sunday that the
administration plans to keep all four battleships in the fleet
despite the explosion.
   ``They are effective, they were relatively cheap to bring back
into the service compared to new ships, they are good cruise
missile platforms, so I think they do have a role to play,'' Cheney
said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
   Critics have charged that the battleship's 16-inch guns are
antiquated and dangerous; gunners say they are among the most
accurate available.
