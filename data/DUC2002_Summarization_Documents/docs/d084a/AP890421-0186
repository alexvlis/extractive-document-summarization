   The damaged battleship USS Iowa steamed home
from Puerto Rico on Friday while investigators on board interviewed
crewmen and reviewed an amateur videotape of the explosion that
killed 47 sailors.
   Ens. Karl Johnson, an Atlantic Fleet spokesman, said the Navy
would not release the exact position of the ship, which was
expected to reach its home port here about 5:30 p.m. Sunday.
   The Washington Post reported in its Saturday editions that
crewmen in the upper chambers of the gun turret were killed by the
explosion and fire while sailors working several levels below
suffocated when the blast sucked all the oxygen out of the spaces.
   Navy investigators also said the explosion left two fully loaded
gun barrels in the turret, the newspaper reported.
   The explosion came after two of the three guns had been loaded
and just after the crew had been given permission to load and fire
the center gun, the newspaper said.
   After the fire was extinguished, crew men worked quickly to
remove the shells and powder from the other two guns before they
could explode, the newspaper said.
   Meanwhile, NBC News reported that the exact cause of the blast
in one of the ship's three 16-inch gun turrets on Wednesday may
never be known because the destruction inside the turret was so
complete.
   The Navy released photographs of the firefighting effort, which
authorities said required two hours to put out the blaze and cool
off the turret before anyone could enter it.
   During the trip home, investigators on board were reviewing a
videotape of the turret taken by an Iowa officer who had wanted to
record the firing of the big guns when the explosion occurred, said
Lt. Cmdr. James Cudler, a Pentagon spokesman. He said the
investigators had not decided whether to release the tape to the
public. Investigators were also interviewing crew members.
   Maj. Tom Johnston, a spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet in
Norfolk, said he had no information on the cause of death of the 47
crewmen.Navy officials have refused to speculate on the cause of
the explosion.
   In Norfolk, memorial services for the 47 victims are tentatively
set for 9 a.m. Monday. President George Bush is to attend.
   Johnson said the ship is steaming under its own power, and
repeated the Navy's daily report that the ship is seaworthy and in
no danger.
   The 887-foot, 58,000-ton battleship has armor up to 17{ inches
thick. Navy officials have said that the explosion in the No. 2 gun
turret damaged only the turret.
   The top members of the Senate Armed Services Committee said
Friday the panel will hold hearings on the fiery explosion.
   The explosion occurred during open seas gun practice 300 miles
north of Puerto Rico. The Pentagon said the blast ripped through
the middle gun of the three-gun turret, and that that gun had not
been fired prior to the explosion.
   The Pentagon has ordered that no 16-inch gun will be fired until
the investigation is complete. Ships with those guns _ the
battleships Iowa, New Jersey, Missouri and Wisconsin _ were built
during World War II. Some critics have said the 16-inch guns are
outmoded and dangerous.
