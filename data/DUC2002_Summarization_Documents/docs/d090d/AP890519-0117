   President Corazon Aquino on Friday
refused to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return home to die and said
her government won't permit him to be buried here despite ``a last
appeal'' from his wife.
   The 71-year-old Marcos was in critical condition Friday in a
Honolulu hospital after emergency kidney surgery. Hospital
officials said the ousted leader was suffering from renal, cardiac
and pulmonary failure.
   Marcos' wife, Imelda, broadcast an appeal Friday to Mrs. Aquino
to allow her husband to die in his homeland, and his supporters
threatened mass protests if the request is rejected.
   But Mrs. Aquino refused to withdraw her ban on Marcos, and the
Philippine Supreme Court rejected a petition from the former
president's lawyer, Juan David, to order the return. Marcos has
lived in Hawaii since he was ousted three years ago in a popular
uprising that propelled Mrs. Aquino to power.
   ``I would like first of all to convey to the family of Mr.
Marcos that I do pray that he will still recover from this latest
critical illness,'' Mrs. Aquino said. ``I regret very much it is
not possible for us to allow him to return.''
   She said she has ``said in the past that we will not allow his
remains to be brought back here, and we have already taken plans to
avoid any untoward incidents.''
   Mrs. Aquino, whose government has survived six coup attempts,
has cited national security in refusing previous requests.
   In a statement broadcast by a pro-Marcos radio station, Mrs.
Marcos said she has tried to telephone Mrs. Aquino from Hawaii but
was told the president was busy.
   Maria Elena Cruz, Mrs. Aquino's daughter and personal secretary,
said the president received no calls from Mrs. Marcos.
   Mrs. Marcos said she was trying to contact the president ``to
make a last appeal to Madame Corazon Aquino to open her heart and
let Ferdinand come home because he is in very serious condition.''
   ``My countrymen, I am appealing to each and every one of you to
pray that, hopefully, Mrs. Aquino will know that bringing home
Marcos will bring true reconciliation, true peace and unity for our
country,'' Mrs. Marcos said. ``This is what's best for the
country.''
   Mrs. Aquino had said earlier: ``I regret to inform Mrs. Marcos,
if indeed she is asking me for reconsideration, because as I have
said in the past, much as I agree that Mr. Marcos has his rights, I
still have to consider also the rights and interests of millions of
Filipinos.''
   When told of Mrs. Aquino's statement, Mrs. Marcos said ``We are
aware, but I am a believer and I am an optimist. I know miracles
can happen.''
   Marcos supporters, meanwhile, announced they would hold rallies
Saturday to pray for his recovery. Pro-Marcos leaders warned the
former president's death in exile would trigger demonstrations.
   ``We expect tactical alliances in this nationwide mass action,''
said pro-Marcos lawyer Oliver Lozano. ``We refer to the tactical
alliances of the military, labor sector and student sector.''
   But the chief of staff, Gen. Renato de Villa, said the armed
forces would accept Mrs. Aquino's decision and was prepared to
block any attempts by the opposition to foment trouble.
   ``We will do everything in our power to see to it that law and
order prevail,'' de Villa told reporters. ``We will follow any
decision by the executive branch.''
