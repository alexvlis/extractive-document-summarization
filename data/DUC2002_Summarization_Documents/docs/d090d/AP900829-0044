   President Corazon Aquino today
reversed a long-held policy and said she was willing to negotiate
cease-fires with Communist guerrillas and former soldiers who have
staged coup attempts.
   Mrs. Aquino also invited the opposition to join the talks,
including her most outspoken critic, Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile.
   Manila has been rocked by almost daily explosions. Although no
one has claimed responsibility for the blasts, the government has
blamed them on former soldiers who have repeatedly tried to toppled
Mrs. Aquino in coup attempts.
   The Communist rebels have been waging a 21-year rebellion to
establish a Marxist state. The last cease-fire with them collapsed
in early 1987.
   Sen. Wigberto Tanada called for a truce between the government
and the Communist rebels after a major earthquake in the
Philippines on July 16, but Mrs. Aquino rejected the proposal.
   On Tuesday, a pro-Aquino senator, Orlando Mercado, urged Mrs.
Aquino to put aside differences with her political foes and begin
to discuss the nation's security problems and economic woes.
   Enrile said he was willing to reconcile with Mrs. Aquino, who
fired him as defense minister after he was implicated in a coup
attempt in November 1986.
   Mrs. Aquino said in a statement today that Mercado and Enrile
are welcome to join discussions now being held by a committee of
Cabinet members.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos has adamantly refused any
cease-fire with the Communist guerrillas since November 1986 when
the Aquino government negotiated with the rebels during a 60-day
truce.
   Ramos, a member of the Cabinet committee, has been credited with
crushing six coup attempts against Mrs. Aquino.
   Communists have accused him of whipping up threats of another
coup attempt against Mrs. Aquino so that the civilian leadership
would become indebted to him. Ramos has denied all allegations.
   The last cease-fire with the rebels collapsed in January 1987
after troops fired on farmers demonstrating outside Mrs. Aquino's
office for land reform.
