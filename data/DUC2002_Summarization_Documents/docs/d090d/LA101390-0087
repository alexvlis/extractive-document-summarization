The quick collapse of a bizarre military revolt on the Philippines' 
second-largest island leaves President Corazon Aquino's beleaguered government 
with a muddied victory at best and clear danger signs ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say Aquino's immediate use of small bombers and artillery to end 
a pocket rebellion led by renegade army Col. Alexander Noble on the north coast 
of Mindanao helps counter oft-heard criticism that her four-year-old government 
is indecisive and inept. 
</P>
<P>
And despite widespread fears that the Oct. 4-6 uprising would quickly spread to 
military garrisons on other islands and become a major threat to Aquino, 
leaders of the rightist military underground failed to move. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the coup attempt that didn't catch fire," one Western diplomat said. 
"It sort of fizzled before anything could happen." 
</P>
<P>
But he and other diplomats see little benefit for Aquino's battered image 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
"The international consequence is people saying, 'Yet another revolt in the 
Philippines.' It's like she's under a perpetual onslaught," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, questions linger as to how Noble and about 350 rebel troops so easily 
evaded a much-publicized military manhunt to drive 140 miles from their 
mountain sanctuary, pass unhindered through at least 10 military checkpoints 
and seize two military camps, including the command post of the general who had 
been ordered to capture him -- all without firing a shot. 
</P>
<P>
Noble, once chief of staff of Aquino's own security detail, quickly linked up 
with Reuben Canoy, a local politician who heads the so-called Mindanao 
Independence Movement. 
</P>
<P>
The resource-rich island has spawned secession groups since the 16th Century -- 
though Canoy's is the first to print fake passports and currency based on crude 
counterfeits of U.S. $5 bills. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing was kind of a farce," one Asian diplomat said. "Only in the 
Philippines." 
</P>
<P>
Noble, best known for his long goatee and red stocking cap, quickly surrendered 
with most of his motley army of soldiers and Higaonon tribal militiamen after 
two World War II-vintage T-28 planes, called Tora Toras here, bombed and 
strafed one of the camps. One plane later crashed and the pilot drowned, the 
revolt's only fatality. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino has now survived two major coup attempts and half a dozen assorted and 
aborted military mutinies. Most ended in embarrassing standoffs or dragged on 
for days, as top military leaders hedged on ordering troops to fire on other 
soldiers. In one case, mutineers were ordered to do push-ups and attend Bible 
class as punishment. 
</P>
<P>
"This time was a different government response altogether, which Noble clearly 
had underestimated," said University of the Philippines political scientist 
Alex Magno. "He expected another standoff and hoped for other camps to defect. 
He got bombed instead." 
</P>
<P>
After the revolt, the government toughened its anti-coup law, boosting the 
maximum penalty from 12 years to life in prison. Aquino's spokesman, Tomas 
Gomez III, urged other rebel leaders to take "the honorable way out" -- 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Noble made his move on the day a presidential fact-finding board 
issued a long-awaited 609-page report on the causes of last December's coup 
attempt in Manila, which left more than 100 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
After 332 witnesses, 226 sworn statements and 4,100 documents, the so-called 
Davide Commission concluded that coup attempts are likely to continue -- but 
unlikely to succeed -- for the indefinite future. 
</P>
<P>
Commission member Delfin Lazaro estimated that 70 officers involved in last 
December's coup attempt, which came closest to toppling Aquino, are still at 
large and still plotting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be very difficult for them to get the critical mass to launch a 
successful coup," he said. "But they'll keep trying. What else can they do?"
