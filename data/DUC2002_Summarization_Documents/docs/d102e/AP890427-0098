   An outpouring of sympathy from presidents to
childhood neighbors followed the death of Lucille Ball, but many
said the queen mother of comedy will live on through television
reruns and her influence on comedy.
   The daffy, redheaded comedian whose harebrained schemes drove
her television family crazy and delighted viewers for four decades
died Wednesday of a ruptured abdominal artery at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center. She was 77 and died eight days after emergency
heart surgery.
   A private burial was planned, reportedly with no funeral
services in accordance with Miss Ball's wishes.
   ``God has her now, and, thanks to television, we'll have her
forever,'' said comedian and longtime friend Bob Hope.
   Hospital switchboards were swamped with condolence calls and
thousands of cards after Miss Ball's death, spokesman Ron Wise
said. Miss Ball's family requested that any flowers sent to the
Medical Center in her memory be distributed to other patients.
   Miss Ball maintained her sense of humor even when she was
critically ill. Following her operation last week, her first words
to her daughter, Lucie, were: ``Wouldn't you know _ this is the day
I was going to get my hair done.''
   Miss Ball had been improving steadily from the heart surgery, so
her death came as a shock.
   ``She had been walking, her spirits were up. Her family was with
her,'' Wise said. ``She responded as well as anyone could respond
to that kind of surgery.''
   He said she woke up early Wednesday complaining about a sudden
pain in her back, and in a matter of seconds went into a full
cardiac arrest that was caused by a ruptured aorta.
   Miss Ball and her late former husband, Desi Arnaz, starred in
``I Love Lucy'' from 1951 to 1957. In the ground-breaking show,
still seen in syndication worldwide, the late Vivian Vance and
William Frawley played their neighbors, Fred and Ethel Mertz.
   ``Probably a lot of what she did rubbed off on what I do,'' said
actress-comedian Jane Curtin, star of the sitcom ``Kate and
Allie.'' ``But it couldn't be helped, because I memorized her
shows.''
   The show, one of the most popular in television history, was
distinguished by Miss Ball's faultless timing, rubber-faced
expressions, wide-mouthed wails and extravagant pratfalls.
   ``Working with Lucy was like receiving an M.A. or a Ph.D. in
comedy,'' recalled Joan Rivers. ``What she forgot about comic
timing and delivery is more than most of us will ever learn in a
lifetime.''
   Comedian Whoopi Goldberg said: ``Lucy was great because she
represented every person. She showed us human foibles and gave us a
chance to laugh at ourselves.''
   Miss Goldberg said her favorite episode involved a visit by the
``I Love Lucy'' characters to Hollywood, where Lucy and Ethel
spotted actor William Holden in a restaurant.
   ``That was how we would all react to seeing a movie star in a
restaurant,'' Miss Goldberg said. ``She was looking at him in a
compact mirror, and trying to look at him surreptitiously. And
that's just an example of how everyone can identify with Lucy.''
   Bob Rosati, who lives down the street from the Beverly Hills
home Miss Ball shared with husband Gary Morton, said he was
watching a rerun of ``I Love Lucy'' on Wednesday morning when the
screen went black and the words ``In Memory of Lucille Ball,
1911-1989'' appeared.
   ``I felt I had lost someone in my family. I couldn't believe
it,'' said Rosati, 40. ``I was watching Lucy like I do every
morning. She's one of the most-admired ladies in this town.''
   He was among a group of fans who stood reverently outside Miss
Ball's home on Roxbury Drive as florists delivered baskets of
flowers to the house. Tour vans passed by in a non-stop procession.
   On Hollywood Boulevard's Walk of Fame, flower arrangements were
placed on Miss Ball's two stars _ one for her film work, one for
television.
   Budd Friedman, owner of the Improvisation comedy clubs, said,
``The world of comedy has lost its first lady. Her death is an
irreparable loss ... to our industry.''
   Actor Danny DeVito recalled getting a personal congratulation
from Miss Ball in 1981 when he won an Emmy for the TV series
``Taxi.''
   ``It made it like it had been blessed,'' he recalled.
   Admirers included President Bush, in Southern California at the
time of Miss Ball's passing, and former President Reagan.
   ``Her red hair, her antics on the screen, her timing and her
zest for life made her an American institution,'' the former
president and Nancy Reagan said in a statement. ``Just the mention
of her name brings a smile. ... We love Lucy and will miss her
deeply.''
   ``Lucille Ball possessed the gift of laughter,'' Bush said.
``But she also embodied an even greater treasure _ the gift of
love. She appealed to the gentler impulses of the human spirit. She
was not merely an actress or comedienne. She was Lucy and she was
loved.''
   ``To baby boomers, a happy chunk of our childhood is missing,''
said ``Saturday Night Live'' comedian Victoria Jackson, who was
born two years after ``I Love Lucy'' went off the air as a regular
series. ``She didn't make me laugh out loud, I remember, she just
made me happy about life.''
   Said comic Tim Conway: ``We're going to miss this lady, but not
really, because she's still here. All those wonderful things they
did together ... those wonderful TV shows ... are still available.''
   Although Miss Ball hadn't visited her hometown of Jamestown,
N.Y, since 1956 and had no family there, she had stayed in touch
with friends.
   Irene Rosseti, who now lives in Celoron, N.Y., said Miss Ball
recently had sent her and her husband a letter on their 50th
wedding anniversary.
   ``Even though she was a big star, she was still just Lucy to
us,'' she recalled.

   Hospital spokesman Wise said that the family has
asked that donations be sent to the Lucille Ball Foundation, in

Angeles, Ca. 90067.
