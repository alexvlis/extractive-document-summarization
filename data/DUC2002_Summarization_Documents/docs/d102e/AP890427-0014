   She never knew how great she was.
   Amid the blimp-size egos of the entertainment world, Lucille
Ball stood out like an orange beacon. She never bragged. She never
exercised her considerable power. She always seemed astonished,
even embarrassed, when honors inevitably came her way.
   When she was to receive a humanitarian award from Variety Clubs
on a CBS special five years ago, she told me: ``There comes a time
in your life when you get a lot of plaques. It's very flattering
and I'll go along with it, especially if it benefits children.''
   Whenever she was praised for ``I Love Lucy,'' she invariably
replied: ``Well, all of the credit should go to (writers) Madelyn
Pugh and Bob Carroll Jr.'' Or, ``Desi was a genius: He was
responsible for the show's success.'' Or she cited co-stars Desi,
Vivian Vance and Bill Frawley.
   Yes, the writing and producing and casting of ``I Love Lucy''
were marvelous, but Lucy's performance added the quantum force. Her
inspired pantomime could be written by no one: the growing panic as
the chocolate assembly line speeded up; her catalog of pained
expressions after tasting the patent medicine she was demonstrating.
   Unlike many stars, Lucille Ball rarely indulged in
self-analysis. But on one occasion she revealed why her feelings
about the ``I Love Lucy'' triumph might have been ambivalent:
   Living through the last five years of the show, she said, ``took
the edge off any enjoyment I might have had. Desi's drinking and
carousing were a terrible embarrassment, bad for a woman's
self-esteem. The talk around town was `poor Lucy.' Because I
couldn't face people, I became a recluse for more than 5{ years.
   ``I never demonstrated my unhappiness at the studio, and
actually, working together was a blessing. Desi had everything so
well organized that it was easy to do the work.''
   Lucy was late in reaching her comedy potential. She was 40 when
``I Love Lucy'' started on CBS and revolutionized television. And
although she spent many years in Hollywood, ``none of the studios
ever designed comedies for me the way MGM did for Red Skelton,
Paramount did for Bob Hope and Sam Goldwyn did for Danny Kaye,''
she once said.
   ``Television was the medium for me, the medium for anyone who
wanted to be well known a lot faster than waiting a year and a half
for a movie to come out,'' she said in an interview late in life.
``Television is an instant barometer, especially the way we did it.
   ``It was all new. Nobody knew anything about television. Nobody
was there to say, `No, don't do that, it's wrong!' We never knew
what was wrong and what was right. We were all feeling our way.
Desi was very innovative and very showmanship-conscious and was
very intent on going ahead and doing it: `That sounds all right,
let's go!' So we went.''
   Always the credit to someone else. But millions upon millions of
television watchers know otherwise.
