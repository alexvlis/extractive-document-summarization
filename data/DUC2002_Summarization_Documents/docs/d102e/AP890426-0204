   Actor Gale Gordon, a sidekick of
Lucille Ball from radio days who appeared with her in three
television series, recalled on Wednesday how the comedian never
thought of herself as particularly funny.
   ``Oh, but when she told a story or recalled an event that
happened she always illustrated it with her body and her face,''
the 83-year-old Gordon said in a telephone interview. ``She never
saw it, but she was extremely amusing.''
   Gordon, who is appearing in a play in Edmonton, spent the day in
an Edmonton hotel room, mourning the death of Lucille Ball in a Los
Angeles hospital Wednesday at age 77 and quietly remembering his
funny friend.
   ``The world will miss her greatly,'' the actor said. ``I
personally will remember her as the best talent of her kind in the
world ... a wonderful, warm friend and a bit of a genius _ the only
one I've ever really known.''
   In his first television series alongside Miss Ball, Gordon was
the flustered banker Mr. Mooney in ``The Lucy Show'' from 1962-68.
The next six years saw him as Harrison Carter on ``Here's Lucy.''
   They were reunited briefly in 1986 for the short-lived ``Life
With Lucy.''
   Gordon first met Miss Ball in 1947 on the radio program ``My
Favorite Husband,'' which later became ``I Love Lucy'' on
television.
   ``I thought she was a very good-looking young woman, and very
talented,'' he recalled. ``She was very pleasant to work with. None
of us knew what was going to happen _ television was very young
then and it wasn't taken too seriously. We never dreamed it would
ever become the power it was ... and the great stars it would
produce.''
   Gordon last spoke to Miss Ball from Edmonton on his birthday,
Feb. 20, when ``she called to wish me a happy birthday as she has
done for years and years.''
   Gordon has done regular stints for years at a chain of
Edmonton-based dinner theatres called Stage West. He is currently
appearing with that company's Mayfair Dinner Theatre as a priest in
the play ``Mass Appeal.''
   The play has another month to run and Gordon says that means he
won't be able to attend Miss Ball's funeral.
   ``I couldn't do that because it would put people out of work,''
he said. ``She would be the first one to scream her head off if I
did that.''
