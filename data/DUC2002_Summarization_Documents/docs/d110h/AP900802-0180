   THE INVASION: Iraq's troops, led by about 350 tanks, crossed the
border at dawn Thursday, and seized the Kuwaiti palace and
government buildings 40 miles away. Early Friday, the invaders
controlled Kuwait city, the capital. The soldiers were also making
sweeps through the southern oilfields, according to residents and
Lloyds' insurance service in London. Diplomatic sources estimate
more than 200 Kuwaitis were killed or wounded, mainly from the
Emiri Guard which bore the main brunt of the invasion. Kuwait's
Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah fled to safety in Saudi Arabia.
   
   THE FORCES: Iraq, a country of more than 17 million, has the
Arab world's most battle-trained army, and had massed more than
100,000 soldiers on the Kuwaiti border. Kuwait, an oil-rich
city-state, has 1.9 million residents _ 60 percent foreigners _ and
an army of 20,300 soldiers.
   
   CAUSE OF CONFLICT: President Saddam Hussein of Iraq accused
Kuwait of stealing oil from its territory and forcing down oil
prices through overproduction. Kuwait and U.N. diplomats dismissed
Iraq's claim that it invaded at the request of Kuwaiti
revolutionaries.
   
   REACTION: The U.N. Security Council voted 14-0 to condemn the
invasion.
   President Bush denounced it as ``naked agression.'' He froze
Iraq's assets in the United States and blocked almost all Iraqi
imports, including oil. The order also froze Kuwait property under
U.S. jurisdiction _ a move intended to keep Iraq from seizing it.
   The Soviets also condemned the invasion and stopped arms sales
to Iraq.
   Kuwait's U.S. ambassador said the nation had asked for American
military intervention.
   A Pentagon source said a U.S. naval group was diverted toward
the Persian Gulf.
   Oil prices soared in frenzied trading amid fears the invasion
would reduce the supply of oil.
