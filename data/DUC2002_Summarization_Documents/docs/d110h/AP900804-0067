   Saudi Arabia has been subdued in its
reaction to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, which places Iraqi forces
near the oil-rich kingdom's border.
   Oil executives said Saudi Arabia has not and will not take the
most potent action possible against Iraq _ closing the pipeline
that carries Iraqi oil for export across Saudi Arabia to the Red
Sea.
   The executives said the Saudis believe this would give Iraq's
belligerent president, Saddam Hussein, an excuse to attack and
occupy Saudi oil fields 150 miles south of Kuwait, giving Iraq
control of more oil than any other country in the world.
   The only direct Saudi statement since the invasion was made by
an anonymous government spokesman through the official Saudi Press
Agency the day after the Iraqi move.
   The statement said Saudi Arabia was following the Kuwait
situation ``with extreme concern'' and that King Fahd would be
seeking to calm the situation and to find a solution ``in a manner
ensuring the interests of all.'' The statement did not condemn the
invasion.
   The only tangible help Saudi Arabia gave the Kuwaiti government
in the wake of the invasion was to shelter members of the ruling
family, including the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and the
crown prince. Both nations are tightly run by royal families and
have been close allies.
   The Saudis also allowed the Kuwaiti royal family to briefly
operate a radio, reportedly from a mobile van, in the area around
the Saudi-Kuwait border.
   But Friday the radio went off the air after a desperate call:
``The people of Kuwait appeal to you oh brethren, oh Arabs, oh
beloved brothers, oh Moslems, rush, rush to their help.''
   It was not known if the radio had been discovered by the Iraqis
or shut down by the Saudis to avoid provoking Saddam at a time when
fears were being expressed that he might invade Saudi Arabia as
well.
   Saudi Arabia borders Kuwait and Iraq's invasion forces were
reportedly near the Saudi border.
   The Saudis did condemned the invasion as part of a joint
statement issued by the Gulf Cooperation Council, in which it is
allied with Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and
Bahrain.
   The six states issued a statement saying, ``We strongly condemn
and are very sorry for this attack that one Arab state took against
another Arab state. ... We do not recognize anything resulting from
it.''
   Iraq's 1-million-member armed forces is clearly too much for the
joint 3,000-member Gulf Cooperation Council force or Saudi Arabia's
65,700-member army.
   Saudi Arabia was also one of the 14 members of the 21-member
Arab League that condemned the invasion in the same terms as the
Gulf Cooperation Council.
   The Arab League, with one-third of its members voting against
the resolution or abstaining, was clearly unable to take any direct
action.
   Turkey has also refused to take action and has not commented
about President Bush's suggestion that it cut off Iraq's oil
pipeline to the Mediterranean. Two parallel pipelines pump Iraqi
crude oil to a terminal at Yumurtalik at the eastern corner of
Turkey's Mediterranean coast and constitute Iraq's major oil export
outlet.
