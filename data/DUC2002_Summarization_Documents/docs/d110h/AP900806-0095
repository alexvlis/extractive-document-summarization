   The U.N. Security Council today
overwhelmingly approved sweeping trade and military sanctions
against Iraq, including a ban on oil purchases, to punish Baghdad
for invading Kuwait.
   The vote was 13-0, with two abstentions by Cuba and Yemen on the
15-member council, which adopted the sanctions resolution proposed
by the United States. It said Iraq had launched an armed attack
against Kuwait and usurped the authority of Kuwait's legitimate
government.
   The sanctions were intended to force Iraq to withdraw its troops
from Kuwait and the resolution bans ``the import into their
territories of all commodities and products originating in Iraq or
Kuwait and exported there from after the date of this resolution.''
   President Bush praised the decision and called for ``full and
total implementation of these sanctions, ruling out nothing at
all.''
   He told reporters at the White House: ``The will of nations
around the world will be to enforce these sanctions.''
   It was the third time in its 45-year existence that the world
body had voted sanctions against a member state. The last time was
1967 when the Security Council voted similar, comprehensive
sanctions against the white minority government of Rhodesia.
   An arms embargo against South Africa still is in effect.
   The sanctions are legally binding for all member nations,
although past council resolutions have often been ignored or
flouted. The United Nations has no enforcement mechanism but later
could call on members to take military action against Iraq or
impose a blockade.
   The vote followed similar sanctions imposed on Iraq by much of
the West, including the United States, Japan and the European
Community. The Soviet Union and China said they would halt arms
shipments to Iraq.
   In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency on Sunday, the
Iraqi-installed military government of Kuwait warned other nations
not to take ``punishing measures'' against it or Iraq. The
provisional government said countries ``have to remember they have
interests and citizens in Kuwait.''
   The U.N. role in the Iraq-Kuwait crisis assumed increasing
importance after divided Arab nations canceled a weekend emergency
summit on the invasion.
   In an emergency session just hours after Thursday's invasion,
the Security Council condemned Iraq's invasion, demanded immediate
and unconditional troop withdrawal, and called for negotiations
between Iraq and Kuwait.
   The council threatened to impose sanctions if Iraq did not
comply.
   The council includes the five permanent members with veto power
_ the United States, Britain, China, France and the Soviet Union.
The 10 non-permanent members are: Canada, Colombia, Cuba, Ethiopia,
Finland, Ivory Coast, Malaysia, Romania, Yemen and Zaire.
