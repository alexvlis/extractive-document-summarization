   An emergency Arab League Council failed to
publicly condemn Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Thursday and
adjourned its meeting for 24 hours as Arab leaders held urgent
consultations on how to handle the crisis.
   Kuwait's Cabinet affairs minister, Abdel-Rahman el-Awadi told
reporters he asked the 21-nation Arab League to condemn the attack.
He accused Iraq of using the ``laws of the jungle.''
   President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Hussein met in
Alexandria and telephoned Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, President
Bush, Saudi King Fahd and Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Saleh on
the crisis. Hussein later left for home.
   Sources close to the Arab League Council said its members agreed
to convene an emergency Arab summit but decided to leave the when
and where up to Arab leaders. The sources spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The Council meeting of foreign ministers was convened in Cairo
at Kuwaiti request hours after Iraqi military forces took over the
small Persian Gulf state. Some member nations sent lower-level
representatives.
   Following its evening session, attended by Saadoon Hamadi, a
member of the Iraqi Revolutionary Council, Foreign Minister Esmat
Abdel-Meguid of Egypt told reporters the Council would meet again
Friday.
   Saddam promised Mubarak two weeks ago that he would not invade
Kuwait in their oil dispute.
   At Thursday's closed session, Hamadi reiterated Iraq's claim its
forces entered Kuwait at the request of a Kuwaiti revolutionary
group that had overthrown the government.
   A conference source said several Arab foreign ministers replied
that ``they considered this to be an Iraqi invasion which is
against all United Nations and Arab League conventions.''
   So far, only Lebanon's prime minister and foreign minister,
Salim Hoss, has joined Kuwait in Cairo in publicly condemning the
invasion _ the first time in modern history one Arab country
invaded another to take control of the government.
   Hoss told reporters, ``We do not see any justification for what
happened, whatever the arguments and pretexts.''
   The invasion was denounced by the United States and other
Western nations and by the Soviet Union.
   The Arab League Council met early Thursday and then adjourned to
await the arrival of Hamdoon. Iraq's ambassador to Egypt, Nabil
Najm, sat in until Hamdoon arrived.
   ``The United Nation's Security Council has condemned the
invasion and the issue is now being discussed within the framework
of the Arab League and we hope that it will issue a condemnation
within the hour and that Arabs stand against this invasion,''
Kuwait's Awadi said.
   ``Arab leaders must take the initiative and stop this bloodshed
and return things to their normal situation. We also call on Iraq
to withdraw its troops.''
   Hamadi told reporters upon arrival, ``I see this meeting as
unnecessary ... There is no government presently in Kuwait. There
is a group which started the revolution and which will reveal
itself shortly.''
   His comments were carried by the Middle East News Agency.
   MENA said Kuwait invoked the 1950 Arab joint defense pact and
asked the Arab League Council to dispatch a joint Arab force to
``defend Kuwait against the invasion.''
   In the event of military aggression against any League member,
the pact all members, to ``take, individually and collectively, all
steps available, including the use of armed force, to repel the
aggression and restore security and peace.''
   The ministers were in Cairo to attend the Organization of
Islamic Conference's foreign ministers meeting. All Arab League
members also belong to the Islamic conference.
