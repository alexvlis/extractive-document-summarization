<LEADPARA>  THE PHOTOGRAPHER caught Winnie Mandela as she left the court after her
conviction for kidnapping. She was smiling exuberantly, as if she had just won
a great victory. Behind her was Nelson Mandela, eyes downcast, looking
stricken and exhausted.;    That remarkable, terrible picture spoke volumes
about the drama of South Africa today, the human factors and the politics.
Most of all, it reminded us of the unimaginable burdens borne by one
72-year-old man.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In the 15 months since he walked free from prison, Nelson Mandela has
played the chief role in talks with President F.W. de Klerk and the white
government. He has presided over an African National Congress divided and not
yet organized for politics. He has spent his moral capital trying,
unsuccessfully, to end the murderous conflict between black political
factions.;    Now Mandela is confronted with his wife's conviction for a
brutal criminal offense. He has loyally defended her innocence. He has seemed
to hear no voice to the contrary. But events have caught up.;    The radicals
in the ANC may well use the trial and conviction of Mrs. Mandela to arouse
members against Nelson Mandela's policy of peace and negotiation.;    There
are rumors that at a national conference next month the radicals will try to
move such older leaders as Mandela and Walter Sisulu aside to a nominal senior
role.;    It is a gloomy picture: an elderly man bearing the hopes of peace in
South Africa beset by problems, personal trauma on top of political. But I
think it would be wrong to conclude that the South African drama is
necessarily heading toward a tragic end.;    One reason for a degree of
optimism is the way South Africans on all sides, most of them, have dealt with
Winnie Mandela's trial: calmly and fairly.;    During the years of white
supremacy the law has been viciously misused. But from all one can tell, this
trial was handled professionally by the judge, Justice Michael Stegmann.;   
The reaction to the verdict and six-year prison sentence was also mild.
Surprisingly few supporters gathered outside the court to cheer Mrs. Mandela.
The ANC issued a detached statement saying that the last word had not been
spoken in the case. Archbishop Desmond Tutu said "the movement is larger than
any individual.";    A more fundamental reason for hope is that F.W. de Klerk
and Nelson Mandela -- and those for whom they speak -- have a common interest
in creating a new, non-racial South Africa. They need each other. Without
their agreement, there can be no solution, no outcome that leaves a viable
country.;    The next step is formal negotiations. They can come only when the
government takes further steps to meet the reasonable ANC demand for action
against violence -- in particular, a ban on the carrying of so-called
"cultural" weapons such as spears. How can the government look away when 1,000
Zulus carrying spears and machetes slaughter township residents?;    The time
factor is crucial now. Negotiations must start soon if the moderate center of
the public, black and white, is to retain hope for a peaceful solution. World
and time press on Nelson Mandela.  </TEXT>
