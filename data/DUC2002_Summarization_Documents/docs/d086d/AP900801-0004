   Iraqi troops have launched an offensive
against Kuwait, the Kuwaiti embassy said Wednesday night.
   Faleh Bader, director of the ambassador's office, said, ``We
confirm there is an offensive at Kuwait border and we have no
comment.''
   The attack started about midnight, Kuwaiti time (5 p.m. EDT),
Bader said.
   Earlier in the day, the Iraqi ambassador, Mohamed Al-Mashat, was
summoned to the State Department afternoon for a meeting with
Assistant Secretary John Kelly.
   Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Kelly repeated to the
Iraqi envoy the U.S. desire for a peaceful solution to the tensions
with Kuwait and urged Iraq to respect to sovereignty of all nations
in the region.
   Kelly told a House subcommittee Tuesday that while the United
States has no treaty obligations that would mandate military
support for Kuwait, the United States does believe strongly in
respect for territories of all states in the region.
   The United States, whose Persian Gulf naval patrols helped Iraq
defeat Iran in the 1980-1988 war, has six warships in the area.
They have been conducting exercises since July 23 with forces of
the United Arab Emirates, some 700 miles southest of Kuwait.
   Iraq had moved about 100,000 troops to its border with Kuwait
after claiming that Kuwait's production of oil beyond quotas of the
OPEC cartel had depressed the world price, thus diminishing Iraq's
revenue, and that Kuwait had been stealing oil from a field that
straddles the border.
   Iraqi officials on Wednesday walked out on talks in Jiddah,
Saudia Arabia aimed at resolving the 2-week-old crisis with
neighboring Kuwait and complained that Kuwait was not negotiating
seriously.
   Iraq threatened to invade once before, in 1961 after Britain
ended its protectorate over Kuwait. Iraq then claimed Kuwait as
part of its territory, but the appearance on the Kuwaiti side of
the border of troops from Britain and other Arab states deterred
further action by Iraq.
