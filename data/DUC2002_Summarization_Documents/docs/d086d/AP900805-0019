   The radio of Kuwait's new Iraqi-installed
government claimed that Iraqi troops began pulling out of Kuwait on
Sunday, but the United States said it doubted a withdrawal was
really under way.
   The radio announcement came three days after Iraq invaded Kuwait
and one day after Baghdad said it had replaced the oil-rich
kingdom's ousted monarchy with a new government made up of nine
Kuwaiti army offices.
   Iraq also said Saturday that it was creating a new Kuwaiti army
and that 100,000 Iraqis, the approximate number of soldiers Baghdad
took over Kuwait with, had volunteered for the new military force.
   In other developments:
   _The White House continued to seek the immediate and
unconditional withdrawl of all Iraqi troops, and it thanked the
many nations who have condemned the invasion and imposed economic
sanctions on Baghdad.
   _After several days of debate, Japan on Sunday banned all oil
imports from Iraq and Kuwait and halted Japanese exports to both
countries. Tokyo said it would suspend all loans to Iraq and
Kuwait, ban Japanese investment there, and freeze Iraqi assets in
Japan. Japan, which imports 99 percent of its oil, had relied on
Iraq and Kuwait for more than 11 percent of its oil imports. The
White House hailed Japan's move and said Prime Minister Toshiki
Kaifu called President Bush on Sunday at Camp David to inform him
about the sanctions.
   _Although tens of thousands of Iraqi troops reportedly remained
massed near Kuwait's border with Saudi Arabia, Washington said on
Sunday there was no indication that any soldiers had moved into
Saudi Arabia.
   _The White House said that 11 American oil workers rounded up
after the invasion had been brought to Baghdad, talked with U.S.
Embassy officials, and were in good shape. It said that accounts
for all missing Americans.
   _An unconfirmed report said a warplane from the deposed emir's
air force in Kuwait bombed an Iraqi military headquarters near
Kuwait city. It was not clear where the plane came from or whether
its reported attack caused any damage.
   The radio of Kuwait's new government, monitored in Bahrain,
quoted its ``military correspondent'' as saying the pullout began
at 8 a.m. (1 a.m. EDT).
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein allowed reporters based in
Baghdad to be taken south to Basra overnight to observe the first
Iraqi troops return home.
   But at the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said on
Sunday morning: ``We have no independent or confirmable information
on this report (of the withdrawl beginning). Saddam Hussein's
actions in the past have raised serious skepticism about his
intentions.''
   Iraq declared earlier that the provisional government installed
by Baghdad is capable of ensuring security in the occupied country.
   Baghdad television has said the new government is headed by Col.
Ala Hussein Ali and that he holds the positions of prime minister,
commander-in-chief of the armed forces, minister of defense and
interior minister. The other eight members were lieutenant colonels
and majors.
   But Kuwait's embassy in Amman, Jordan, on Sunday dismissed the
new government as ``a list of fake names'' and said Ali is Saddam's
son-in-law.
   A similar report appeared in one of Cairo's leading newspapers,
Al-Ahram. It quoted the Kuwait Embassy in Tunis which said that Ali
works with Saddam's administration in Baghdad.
   The Iraqi news agency carried a Kuwait-datelined statement it
said was from the provisional government, denying any of its
members were Iraqis.
   In Jordan, Prime Minister Mudar Badran said his nation will not
recognize the new government because that would hinder Arab efforts
to end the conflict.
   U.S., French and British warships, meanwhile, steamed toward the
Persian Gulf. President Bush said Friday that if Iraq moved against
Saudi Arabia it would be attacking U.S. ``vital interests.'' On
Saturday, Bush said in Washington that the use of force in
resolving the crisis remains an option. Saudi Arabia ships 1.2
million barrels of oil to the United States daily.
   Fitzwater said on Sunday that there was no indication Iraqi
forces had moved into Saudi Arabia, even though tens of thousands
of them have been reported to be within 5 to 10 miles of the Saudi
border.
   In Washington, Iraqi ambassador Mohammed al-Mashat on Saturday
denied U.S. and other foreign reports suggesting that Iraq plans to
invade Saudi Arabia.
   Saddam ordered the invasion of Kuwait after accusing it of
stealing oil from a field that straddles their disputed border. He
also blamed Kuwait for a fall in oil prices that cost Iraq $14
billion, saying it contributed to the oil glut by cheating on its
OPEC oil cartel production quotas.
