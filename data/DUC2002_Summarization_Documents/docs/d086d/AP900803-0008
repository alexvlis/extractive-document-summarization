   Here is a brief chronology in the dispute between Iraq and
Kuwait over oil production and their common border.
   July 17 _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein accuses Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates of flooding the oil market and driving prices
down, and that the move cost Iraq $14 billion in lost oil revenue.
He further charges that Arab states in the Persian Gulf are
conspiring with the United States and Israel to weaken Iraq's
economy and undermine its military buildup.
   July 18 _ Iraq accuses Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion worth of
oil from wells along the disputed border with Iraq and of seeking
to wreck Iraq's economy by overproducing oil and thus pushing down
prices.
   July 20 _ Kuwaiti officials suggest Iraq's sudden outburst of
belligerence is aimed at getting its creditors _ including Kuwait _
to write off billions of dollars in debts from the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war.
   July 24 _ The U.S. Defense Department announces that U.S. Navy
warships and aircraft are holding a ``short-notice exercise'' in
the Persian Gulf with the United Arab Emirates, about 600 miles
southeast of the Kuwait-Iraqi border. Kuwait reinstates a state of
alert it declared July 16 and canceled after three days of tension
between the two oil-producing countries.
   July 25 _ The Iraqi government in Baghdad says that it will not
be intimidated by U.S. pressure in its oil dispute with neighboring
Kuwait, and Saddams summons the U.S. ambassador for talks.
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt says Iraq and Kuwait plan to meet
in Saudi Arabia in an effort to resolve their dispute.
   July 26 _ OPEC ministers in Geneva agree to halt overproduction
in hopes of pushing up the price of crude oil. Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates pledge to abide by the agreement. Analysts say
Saddam clearly influenced the outcome of the meetings.
   July 31 _ Kuwaiti and Iraqi delegations meet in Jiddah, Saudi
Arabia, to negotiate the oil and border dispute. Diplomats say Iraq
has massed 100,000 troops on Kuwait's border, more than triple the
number originally estimated. That number dwarfs the Kuwaiti army,
which has a total of about 20,000 troops.
   Aug. 1 _ Iraq pulls out of talks on the 2-week-old border, oil
and money dispute with Kuwait shortly before it sends its forces to
invade the oil-rich sheikdom.
   Aug. 2 _ Iraq's powerful army overruns Kuwait before dawn with
tank-led troops quickly seized the ruler's palace and other
government buildings.
