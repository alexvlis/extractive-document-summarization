   Children whose families escaped the
horrors of the Vietnam War saw their schoolyard turned into a
killing field, the target of a silent gunman armed with a rifle and
a pistol bearing the word ``victory.''
   After the massacre at recess, the bodies of three Southeast Asian
children were outlined in blue on the playground of Cleveland
Elementary School where they died. Two others had been dragged by
teachers inside to a classroom, but also died. Twenty-nine other
pupils were wounded, along with a teacher.
   ``There was shooting all over. ... I was scared,'' said
sixth-grader Binh Hoang, who was born in Vietnam in 1975 in the
final days of war and had never before heard gunfire. ``Everybody
was crying in my class.''
   Police said a drifter identified as Patrick Edward Purdy, 26,
armed with two handguns and an AK-47 assault rifle, entered the
school grounds around noontime Tuesday and fired about 60 rounds
before he shot himself to death.
   Afterward, a large handgun and the assault rifle lay on the
ground near a pool of blood and the gunman's body. The word
``victory'' was written on the pistol handle.
   Binh said she was sitting in math class when the shooting began
outside the wood-and-stucco school building. Her teacher told
students to get under their desks.
   The gunfire startled Michael Cuevas, whose first thought was that
the University of the Pacific fraternities near his house were
firing their miniature cannon again.
   But the shots repeated too rapidly for a cannon, and the scream
of sirens that followed told him this time was no prank.
   ``I never thought a tragedy of this magnitude could happen in
Stockton,'' said Cuevas, a 29-year-old marine clerk at the Port of
Stockton who lives down the street from the elementary school.
   ``It's always in some other town, some other place. It's a shock
to my senses. I don't think it's even hit me as hard as it's going
to. You don't know whether to be excited, or confused or what.''
   Police cars and news reporters crowded the street, which
typically is busy only when parents pick up and drop off their
children.
   ``Why here?'' said Jeff Russell, 37, who was born and reared in
the neighborhood. ``This has always been a sleepy little town. (The
shooting) put us back on the map.''
   Lutheran and Baptist churches border the school in a neighborhood
of ranch-style homes, postage-stamp lawns and streets lined with
sycamore and oak trees in this agricultural city of 150,000 people
60 miles southeast of San Francisco.
   The 40-year-old neighborhood near the University of the Pacific
is still home to many retired couples who raised their familes
there. But the city has been changing with the influx of Southeast
Asian refugees.
   When school officials called clergy to console grieving families,
Buddhist priests in sandals and saffron robes arrived along with
their white-collared Christian counterparts.
   About 60 percent of Cleveland Elementary's students are of
Southeast Asian descent, said John Klose, spokesman for the Stockton
School District. The five children who were killed were Vietnamese
and Cambodian.
   ``This is one of our best neighborhood schools,'' Klose said.
``Of all of our schools that I would think of something like this
happening, this would be the last one I would think of.''
   Across the street, Sarah Abbott stood astride her bicycle and
gazed at the school where she graduated ``many years ago.'' The
professional nanny said she was at the house of her 97-year-old
grandfather about a block from the school when the gunman set his
car on fire before starting to shoot.
   ``When the car exploded, my grandpa's house just shook,'' Abbott
said. ``It scared me. ... It was just too close.''
