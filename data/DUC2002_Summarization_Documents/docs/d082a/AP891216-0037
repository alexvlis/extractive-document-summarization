   In what amounted to a public apology, Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and Soviet leaders today eulogized Andrei D. Sakharov as
a ``man of honesty and sincerity'' who suffered great injustice at
the hands of previous rulers.
   An obituary signed by Gorbachev, five other members of the
ruling Communist Party Politburo and 50 other leading officials and
scholars was printed along with a picture of Sakharov on page 4 of
the party daily Pravda.
   Such obituaries are reserved for favored public figures and
scientists, and Pravda emphasized the importance of the 1975 Nobel
Peace Prize winner by printing a decree about the formation of a
funeral commission in a black box on its front page.
   Sakharov, 68, died Thursday night in his study, just hours after
urging fellow members of the Congress of People's Deputies to
create a formal opposition to the party in their drive to break its
seven-decade strangehold on political power.
   ``A distinguished scientist and public figure, a man of honesty
and sincerity has passed away,'' the obituary said. ``Everything
that Andrei Dmitrievich did was dictated by his conscience, his
deep humanitarian convictions.''
   The obituary noted Sakharov was exiled in the industrial city of
Gorky about 250 miles east of Moscow from 1980 to 1986.
   ``Gross injustices were permitted in relation to A.D.
Sakharov,'' it said.
   It was signed by Gorbachev and fellow Politburo members Nikolai
I. Ryzhkov, Vadim A. Medvedev, Lev N. Zaikov, Alexander N. Yakovlev
and Vitaly I. Vorotnikov.
   However, the signatures of several other Politburo members,
including KGB chief Vladimir A. Kryuchkov and leading conservative
Yegor K. Ligachev were missing. Absence of their signatures could
signify that the disagreed with part of the obituary.
   Ligachev, interviewed by the Tass news agency on Friday, had
said he disagreed with Sakharov but respected him.
   It was Leonid I. Brezhnev, now blamed by Gorbachev for
permitting stagnation and corruption to overcome the Soviet system,
who exiled Sakharov for criticizing the Soviet intervention in
Afghanistan.
   Gorbachev called Sakharov in Gorky in December 1986 and told him
he could return to Moscow.
   The Soviet leader told reporters at the Congress of People's
Deputies that Sakharov's death was a ``great loss.''
   Even though the two often tangled at the Congress, Gorbachev
said he respected Sakharov. ``He was not some sort of political
intriguer,'' the Soviet president said Friday.
   Gorbachev said he would attend Sakharov's funeral Monday
afternoon in southwest Moscow's Vostryakovskoye Cemetery.
   Several hundred people gathered outside Sakharov's apartment
building Friday evening, holding candles and wreathing his
photograph in flowers. Memorial services were scheduled Sunday at
the city's main youth center, and on Monday at the Lebedev physics
institute where Sakharov worked and the Academy of Sciences, of
which he was a leading member.
   The popular nighttime TV program ``Vzglad'' showed a brief
interview with his widow, Yelena Bonner, discussing the funeral
arrangements.
   The obituary also praised Sakharov's vision as a scientist,
which made him the youngest-ever member of the Academy of Sciences
at age 32 and led to his inclusion in a group that developed the
Soviet hydrogen bomb.
   But it said that Sakharov realized the danger of the weapon he
had helped create.
   ``Working on the creation of weapons of mass destruction, A.D.
Sakharov understood early the danger for humanity of their wide
production and testing, and stubbornly placed before the government
the question of limiting such tests,'' it said.
   ``But at that time his appeals were not accepted,'' it said.
``He kept these same positions in the future.''
