<HEAD>Bookmakers Pick Japanese Author to Win Booker Prize</HEAD>

   Six novels have been nominated for the Booker
Prize, Britain's most prestigious fiction award, and bookmakers say
the favorite is ``The Remains of the Day'' by Japanese author Kazuo
Ishiguro.
   The award, to be announced Oct. 26, carries a $31,600 prize
funded by the Booker McConnell food company.
   Oddsmaker William Hill gave 7-to-4 odds on Ishiguro's novel about
a butler's travels through Britain's West Country and said it was
``a firm favorite'' to win.
   Ishiguro, previously nominated for the award, ``was beaten as the
Booker favorite in 1986, which makes his chances that much stronger
this time in our view,'' said William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe.
   The other books nominated are:
   _ ``Cat's Eye,'' a story of painter Elaine Risley and her return
to her childhood home in Toronto by Canadian author Margaret Atwood,
also a previous nominee.
   _ ``The Book of Evidence,'' a prison story of kidnap and murder
convict Freddie Montgomery by John Banville, literary editor of The
Irish Times newspaper.
   _ ``Jigsaw,'' by Sybille Bedford, an autobiographical novel about
an adolescent's travels through Germany, Italy and France.
   _ ``A Disaffection,'' Scottish novelist James Kelman's story
about a school teacher, Patrick Doyle, whose professional
frustrations are fueled by a drinking problem and unrequited love
for a colleague.
   _ ``Restoration,'' British author Rose Tremain's story of Robert
Merivel, a favorite of King Charles II who married the monarch's
youngest mistress.
   ``We expect more interest in this year's Booker Prize than ever
before, partly thanks to last year's controversy over Salman
Rushdie's `Satanic Verses,''' Sharpe said.
   Rushdie was nominated for the prize last year but it was won by
Australian author Peter Carey for his love story ``Oscar and
Lucinda.''
   Rushdie, a British citizen, has been in hiding since Feb. 14 when
the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered he be
killed for allegedly blaspheming Islam in ``Satanic Verses.''
   This year's six nominees were chosen Thursday from 102 books
considered by a panel headed by David Lodge, a British literary
critic and novelist who was nominated for the prize last year for
his book, ``Nice Work.''
