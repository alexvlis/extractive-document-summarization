After hours of heated delib-eration - under a system described as 'mad' by
one judge - the Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize for fiction last night went to Mr
James Kelman for How Late It Was, How Late, published by Secker and Warburg.
The novel, a story of Scottish low-life narrated largely in Glaswegian
dialect, is unlikely to prove a popular choice with booksellers, who have
damned all six books shortlisted for the prize as boring, elitist and -
worst of all - unsaleable.
Professor John Bayley, chairman of the Booker judges, acknowledged that Mr
Kelman's book in particular might be deemed inaccessible. 'We had an
extremely difficult final meeting and were very divided,' he said after
three hours of debate.
Rabbi Julia Neuberger, the only woman on the judging panel, said she was
made extremely cross by the decision. 'It's just a drunken Scotsman railing
against bureaucracy,' she said. 'My eyes are stretched in disbelief. The
voting system is completely mad. Kelman was the least favourite of the three
front runners. If it had been a short story it would have been fine.'
Mr Kelman's book is, according to some observers, the most difficult work to
have won the prize. In his acceptance speech, Mr Kelman, perceived by some
as a Scottish isolationist, anticipated the criticism, by declaring: 'My
culture and my language have the right to exist.'
One guest at the prize-giving dinner at London's Guildhall, Mr Salman
Rushdie, who won the prize in 1981 with Midnight's Children, remarked:
'James Kelman is good, but not as good as he thinks he is.'
The Booker prize has, in its 26-year history, always provoked controversy.
But this year's rows have been of a particularly fine vintage.
Prof Bayley went on record with a rousing condemnation of contemporary
fiction. Another judge, Mr James Wood, literary critic of The Guardian, was
attacked for failing to reveal that a young novelist being considered for
the award, Ms Claire Messud, was in fact Mrs James Wood.
Most damaging of all was the verdict of the booksellers, who dismissed the
shortlist as narcoleptic. The other contenders were The Folding Star by Alan
Hollinghurst, Beside the Ocean of Time by George Mackay Brown, Paradise by
Abdulrazak Gurnah, Reef by Romesh Gunesekera and Knowledge of Angels by Jill
Paton Walsh.
In spite of heavy publicity, the novels nominated have been selling 50 per
cent less than last year's shortlist. Last year's winner, Roddy Doyle's
Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha, sold 350,000 copies. 'Kelman's novel is unlikely to
come anywhere near that,' one bookseller said.
Mr Kelman was also shortlisted for the prize in 1989 for his novel A
Disaffection.
