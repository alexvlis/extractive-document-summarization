Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Ferid Murad of the United 
States on Monday won the Nobel Medicine Prize. They were given the 
prize for their discoveries concerning nitric oxide as a signaling 
molecule in the cardiovascular system, according to the citiation 
from the Karolinska lnstitute. Furchgott is a pharmacologist at the 
State University of New York in Brooklyn, Ignarro is at University 
of California-Los Angeles and Murad is at the University of Texas 
Medical School in Houston. The citation said ``it was a senation that 
the simple, common air pollutant (nitric oxide), which is formed when 
nitrogen burns ... could exert important functions in the organism. 
'' Because of the research, ``we know today that nitric oxide acts 
as a signal molecule in the nervous system, as a weapon against infections 
and as a regulator of blood pressure.'' The prize amount of 7.6 million 
kronor (dlrs 978,000) is divided equally among the three. Last year, 
the prize went to Stanley B. Prusiner of the University of California 
at San Francisco for his discovery of prions, the rogue proteins identified 
as causing Mad Cow Disease. Winners generally aren't known outside 
the medical community, although the list of laureates contains a few 
familiar names including Ivan Pavlov, tuberculosis pioneer Robert 
Koch, and DNA researchers Francis Crick and James Watson. Generally, 
they are researchers who have made discoveries that sound small on 
paper but carry large consequences. Among other well-known names to 
receive the prize is David Baltimore, although he shared the prize 
in 1975, long before becoming one of the world's most visible AIDS 
researchers. Alan Cormack of the United States and Sir Godfrey Hounsfield 
may not be familiar names, but what they won the prize for in 1979 
is a term known by most patients: computer-assisted tomography _ or 
CAT scan. The medicine prize was the second of the six Nobels to be 
announced this year. Last Thursday, the literature prize went to Portuguese 
novelist Jose Saramago. The physics and chemistry prizes will be announced 
Tuesday, the economics prize on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday. 
All the announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize 
which is given in Oslo, Norway. The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, 
the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the industrialist and 
inventor of dynamite whose will established the prizes.
