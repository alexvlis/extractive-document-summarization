Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has declined an informal invitation from 
Lebanon's new president to form the next government, sparking a political 
crisis in this country as it rebuilds from its devastating civil war. 
Sources close to the prime minister, whose Cabinet has been in care-taker 
capacity since last Tuesday's swearing in of Emile Lahoud as president, 
said Hariri turned down the invitation from Lahoud to select a new 
Cabinet. There has been no formal announcement from Lahoud reappointing 
Hariri as prime minister. Although Hariri's move could be a bargaining 
tactic, since he remains the front-runner for the premiership, the 
apparent tension between the two powerful men could affect Lebanon's 
economic stability as it recovers from the 1975-90 civil war. Hariri, 
53, the architect of Lebanon's multibillion dollar postwar reconstruction 
program, has been in power since 1992. A billionaire businessman who 
made his fortune in Saudi Arabia, Hariri is credited with restoring 
economic confidence and stabilizing the national currency. The dispute 
appears to be the opening salvo of a struggle on how Lebanon will 
be governed during Lahoud's six-year term. Toward the end of former 
President Elias Hrawi's nine years in office, Hariri virtually had 
a free hand in running the country. Lahoud, 62, a former commander 
of Lebanon's army, was propelled to power with widespread popular 
backing. He pledged in a tough inauguration speech to clean up the 
graft-riddled administration. The British-trained general made his 
name rebuilding the army after it disintegrated in the civil war. 
Similar political disputes in Lebanon in the past have been solved 
only with the intervention of Syria, the main power broker in this 
country. Damascus supports both Lahoud and Hariri. Lahoud had been 
expected to issue a presidential decree last week asking Hariri to 
form the next government after the president polled members of the 
128-seat Parliament on their choice for prime minister. But many legislators, 
who in the past gave their overwhelming support to Hariri, did not 
name him and, instead, left it to the president to select a prime 
minister. The two leaders met Friday, but no presidential decree followed. 
The sources close to Hariri, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 
the prime minister's decision to bow out came because he did not feel 
Lahoud was following constitutional procedures in selecting the premier.
