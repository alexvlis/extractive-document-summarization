Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, the business tycoon who launched Lebanon's 
multibillion dollar reconstruction from the devastation of civil war, 
said Monday he was bowing out as premier following a dispute with 
the new president. He accused President Emile Lahoud of violating 
the constitution and demanded that he acknowledge it before he could 
reconsider his position. Hariri's move could be a ploy to gain more 
power as a new government is formed, but the crisis atmosphere generated 
by the possible departure of the billionaire businessman could affect 
Lebanon's economic recovery. ``I'm not a candidate,'' Hariri said 
in a live interview with CNN. He demanded that Lahoud admit that he 
acted unconstitutionally by allowing 31 Parliament deputies to authorize 
him to name a prime minister instead of naming one themselves. Such 
an action ``might put the country in danger,'' Hariri warned. Asked 
if there was a risk of renewed conflict in Lebanon over the alleged 
tampering with the constitution, Hariri said: ``If the president continues 
with this, I don't know what will happen.'' But the dispute between 
the two leaders appears to be over who will have the upper hand in 
governing the nation of 3.2 million. Lahoud, 62, is an army commander 
who wants to assert his authority at the start of his six-year presidential 
term. Hariri, 53, virtually has had a free hand in running the country 
since he became premier six years ago under former President Elias 
Hrawi. A brief meeting on Monday between the two did not help resolve 
the disagreements. Hariri's Cabinet has been serving in a caretaker 
capacity since Lahoud's inauguration last Tuesday. Lahoud on Monday 
set the stage for choosing a new prime minister when he scheduled 
a fresh round of consultations with Parliament for Tuesday and Wednesday. 
In a statement, Lahoud said Hariri was asked but declined to form 
the next government after a previous round of consultations. The offer 
came after the 128 legislators polled by the president gave Hariri 
a majority but fell short of the near unanimous backing he had received 
in his previous three mandates since 1992. Hariri is credited with 
restoring economic confidence and stabilizing the national currency. 
His globe-trotting travels to drum up political and economic support 
were sometimes instrumental in drawing international financial aid 
and investment. But he was faulted for declining living standards 
at home and a rise in corruption in government. Lahoud pledged in 
a tough inauguration speech to clean up the graft-riddled administration. 
The general enjoys widespread popular backing after succeeding in 
rebuilding an army fractured by civil war. Central bank officials 
on Monday tried to calm fears about a run on the Lebanese pound by 
announcing that the bank was ready to intervene with its foreign currency 
reserves if necessary, the state-run National News Agency reported. 
It added that the money markets remained stable.
