Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have held discussions about combining 
their business operations, a person involved in the talks said Wednesday. 
It was unclear Wednesday whether talks were continuing. If the companies 
were to merge, it would create the largest U.S. company in terms of 
revenue. A possible merger was reported separately by both The Financial 
Times of London and Bloomberg News. The reported talks between Exxon, 
whose annual revenue exceeds that of General Electric Co., and Mobil, 
the No. 2 U.S. oil company, came as oil prices sank to their lowest 
in almost 12 years. A combined company would be bigger than Royal 
Dutch/Shell Group, the world's largest oil company by revenue. Financial 
terms of the discussions could not be determined Wednesday. Neither 
Exxon or Mobil would comment. Any union would reunite two parts of 
John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, which was broken up by the 
Supreme Court in 1911. Exxon was then known as Standard Oil of New 
Jersey, and Mobil consisted of two companies: Standard Oil of New 
York and Vacuum Oil. As oil prices have plummeted to levels last seen 
in the mid-1980s, oil companies have been under pressure to cut costs. 
Exxon, which has a market value of $176.7 billion, and Mobil, which 
has a market value of $61.1 billion, both have histories of being 
fiercely independent, and both have already cut back on staff and 
made themselves lean to survive even during a prolonged period of 
low oil prices. But this has been a particularly unsettling year for 
the oil industry, and there is little prospect that crude oil prices 
will recover soon. Consequently, chief executives of most oil companies 
have had to swallow their pride and look for suitable partners. This 
summer, British Petroleum announced an agreement to buy Amoco Corp. 
for $48.2 million, creating the world's third-largest oil company 
and prompting analysts to predict even more widespread consolidation. 
``It showed that megamergers are doable,'' said Adam Sieminski, an 
analyst for BT Alex. Brown. He added, however, that any combination 
between Exxon and Mobil would not be an easy match because Mobil has 
been known for being a proud company that has said in the past that 
it would not want to merge. Exxon, he added, is a ``well-run company 
that likes to grow its own businesses.'' He added that the heads of 
both companies, Lee Raymond, the chairman of Exxon, which is based 
in Irving, Texas, and Lucio Noto, the chairman, president and chief 
executive of Mobil, which is based in Fairfax, Va., are different 
personalities. ``It will not be easy,'' he said of combining the two 
far-flung companies, which have vast networks of refineries and gas 
stations that overlap in the United States and Europe. ``If you offer 
enough money you can make anything happen,'' he added. Both companies 
are under pressure to find new fields of oil to help them survive 
in the long term. Like other oil companies, they had hoped to quickly 
tap into the vast reserves of Russia. Even though they were prepared 
to spend billions, they have held back because of the political and 
economic crisis in Russia and great reluctance by Russian officials 
and oil companies to give up control of vast fields. Thus they have 
had to fall back on exploration areas of their own such as the deep 
waters in the Gulf of Mexico as well as West Africa and parts of Asia. 
Such exploration is very expensive, and even when a big field is discovered, 
platforms costing $1 billion or more are required to bring the it 
into production. Oil prices have been under pressure for more than 
a year, falling more than 40 percent from the $20-a-barrel level because 
of growing inventories of petroleum and declining Asian demand caused 
by the economic crisis there. On Wednesday, crude oil for January 
delivery fell 29 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $11.86 a barrel on the 
New York Mercantile Exchange, close to the 12-year low of $11.42 reached 
on June 15. Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries 
and some other oil-producing nations, notably Mexico, have tried to 
stem the price drops with pledges to cut back on production. But those 
pledges have not always been honored, and rallies in the oil market 
this year have proven short-lived. OPEC members on Wednesday continued 
their discussion on extending their production cutbacks, and an agreement 
is expected as early as Thursday. In the spring, OPEC agreed to reduce 
production by 2.6 million barrels a day, about 3 percent of the daily 
world supply of 74 million barrels. The main result of that agreement 
appears to have been to keep oil prices from falling below $10 a barrel. 
Washington regulators said Wednesday that they had not been notified 
about the Exxon-Mobil discussions. The Federal Trade Commission is 
still reviewing British Petroleum's pending purchase of Amoco. An 
Exxon-Mobil deal would be certain to receive several months' worth 
of scrutiny by the commission, which would review how much of the 
industry the combined company would control. Analysts and investment 
bankers were split about the logic of a potential deal. Some pointed 
to difficulties that the companies could face if they were combined. 
``If you asked me if Exxon needed to be bigger, the answer is probably 
no,'' said Garfield Miller, president of Aegis Energy Advisors Corp., 
a small independent investment bank based in New York. ``It is hard 
to say that there is anything in particular to gain.'' In particular, 
Miller said, the two companies have enormous similarities in their 
domestic refining and marketing businesses. ``They really do overlap 
quite a bit,'' he said. ``You really do wonder what is the benefit 
of all that redundancy.'' Another investment banker in the energy 
business, speaking on the condition of anonymity, also questioned 
the rationale for the discussed merger. ``When you look at the BP-Amoco 
deal, you can rationalize it,'' the banker said. ``But none of those 
reasons apply to an Exxon-Mobil deal.'' But Amy Jaffe, an energy research 
analyst with the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy, said 
the combination of the two companies would be logical, in part because 
it would give them greater influence in bidding for development projects 
in the Middle East. ``This is a deal that makes sense,'' Ms. Jaffe 
said. ``With this combined company, there is no project that would 
be too big.'' Ms. Jaffe said the proposed deal would provide each 
company with assets in areas where it had little influence. ``There 
are a lot of complementary assets where they are not redundant,'' 
she said. She said that Exxon, for example, has a strong presence 
in Angola, while Mobil does not. And Mobil has significant assets 
in the Caspian Sea and Nigeria, where Exxon is weak.
