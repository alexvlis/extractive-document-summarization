Endeavour's astronauts connected the first two building blocks of 
the international space station on Sunday, creating a seven-story 
tower in the shuttle cargo bay. It was the first time that the Russian-built 
Zarya control module and the made-in-America Unity chamber had ever 
touched. It looked to be a perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit. 
``We have capture of Zarya,'' commander Robert Cabana announced the 
two pieces came together. ``Congratulations to the crew of the good 
ship Endeavour,'' replied Mission Control. ``That's terrific.'' The 
240-mile-high construction job began two hours earlier with Nancy 
Currie's capture of Zarya (Russian for Sunrise) using the shuttle 
robot arm. ``We're halfway home,'' Cabana said. Then came the hard 
part: stacking the two giant cylinders in the cargo bay. The two station 
pieces are so big _ 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the 
other with a combined mass of 70,000 pounds _ that Currie and her 
crewmates had to rely on a computerized vision system and camera views, 
rather than direct line of sight. This was the first time such a ``blind'' 
docking had ever been attempted. Currie positioned the solar-winged 
Zarya, still on the end of the shuttle robot arm, several inches directly 
above Unity. It was slow going; she wanted and needed perfect alignment. 
Once she was sure she had it, Cabana fired Endeavour's thrusters, 
and the brief burst raised the shuttle and thereby Unity enough for 
the docking mechanisms on the two station components to snap together. 
The historical moment occurred above the South Pacific. The union 
_ intended to last the station's 15-year or more lifetime _ set the 
stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts on Monday to attach electrical 
connectors and cables between the two components. Mission Control 
thought Sunday's work might take hours longer than planned and gave 
the six astronauts plenty of time for the tasks. But everything occurred 
more or less when and how it was supposed to, aside from a piece of 
space junk that strayed too close. Before beginning their final approach 
to Zarya, the six astronauts had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket 
launched last month from California. Mission Control ordered the pilots 
to fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between 
Endeavour and the space junk, putting Endeavour a total of five miles 
from the orbiting debris. The smaller gap would have been ``probably 
a little too close for comfort,'' Mission Control said. The bigger 
worry, by far, was over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, 
and its coupling with Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never 
before handled an object as massive as the 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, 
a power and propulsion module that was launched from Kazakstan on 
Nov. 20. It will provide all of the necessary electricity and steering 
for the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can 
be launched next summer. Minutes after Zarya's capture, Cabana called 
down that two antennas on the module were still undeployed as Russian 
flight controllers had feared. The antennas must be fully deployed 
in order for Zarya's manual docking system to work; that system won't 
be needed before next summer, officials said. The only other problem 
was with a Zarya battery; the astronauts took up a replacement part. 
The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, the first American-made component, 
will serve as a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for future modules. 
It was crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be 
connected with the robot arm, NASA would have sent out two spacewalking 
astronauts to manually fit them together. In all, three spacewalks 
are planned for Endeavour's 12-day flight, not only to hook up electrical 
connections between the two modules but to install handrails and other 
tools for future crews. The joined modules will be released from Endeavour 
once all of the work is completed. NASA estimates 43 more launches 
and 159 more spacewalks will be needed after this mission to assemble 
the entire orbiting complex. Once completed, the 16-nation space station 
will have a mass of 1 million pounds, be longer than a football field, 
and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts.
