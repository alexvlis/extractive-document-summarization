Matthew Shepard, the gay college student who was kidnapped and severely 
beaten, died here Monday, five days after he was found unconscious 
on a Wyoming ranch where he had been left tied to a fence for 18 hours 
in near-freezing temperatures. His death, announced at Poudre Valley 
Hospital here, fanned the outrage that followed word of last week's 
attack, spawning nationwide vigils, producing a call for federal hate-crimes 
legislation from President Clinton and fueling debates over such laws 
in a host of Western states, including Wyoming, that have resisted 
them. From Denver to the University of Maryland, people turned out 
to honor the The slight, soft-spoken 21-year-old Shepard, a freshman 
at the University of Wyoming, who became an overnight symbol of anti-gay 
violence after he was found dangling from the fence by a passerby. 
Russell Anderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 21, were charged with attempted 
murder and are expected to face first-degree murder charges that could 
bring the death penalty. Their girlfriends, Chastity Pasley, 21, and 
Kristen Price, 18, were charged as accessories. In Denver, mourners 
wrote messages on a graffiti wall as part of national Gay Awareness 
Week. In San Francisco, a giant rainbow flag that symbolizes the gay 
rights movement was lowered to half-staff in the Castro district. 
``There is incredible symbolism about being tied to a fence,'' said 
Rebecca Isaacs, political director of the National Gay and Lesbian 
Task Force in Washington. ``People have likened it to a scarecrow. 
But it sounded more like a crucifixion.'' Police in Laramie, Wyo., 
where the beating took place, have said they believed robbery was 
the primary motive for the attack against Shepard, which occurred 
outside a bar in the town of 27,000. But investigators also said Shepard's 
sexuality may have been a factor. Police said Henderson and McKinney 
lured Shepard from the bar by saying they too were gay and one of 
their girlfriends said Shepard had embarassed one of the men by making 
a pass at him. Monday, police said that after leaving Shepard tied 
to the fence, the men returned to Laramie and picked a fight on a 
street corner with two Hispanic men, Emiliano Morales, 19, and Jeremy 
Herrera, 18. McKinney and Morales suffered head injuries in the brawl; 
McKinney was arrested when he sought treatment at the same hospital 
where Shepard died. Gay leaders hope _ and Christian conservatives 
fear _ that Shepard's death will galvanize Congress and state legislatures 
to pass hate-crime legislation or broaden existing laws. Conservatives 
generally oppose such laws because they favor one group's rights over 
another. In the last two decades, 21 states and the District of Columbia 
have passed laws that increase penalties for crimes that are committed 
because of a person's race, religion, color, national origin, and 
sexual orientation. Another 19 states, including Colorado, do not 
include sexual orientation in their hate-crime laws. Ten states, including 
Wyoming, have no hate-crime laws at all. In Washington, Clinton responded 
to news of Shepard's death by urging Congress to pass the federal 
Hate Crimes Protection Act, which would make federal offenses of crimes 
based on sex, disability and sexual orientation. Wyoming has been 
one of the nation's holdouts, rejecting three hate crimes bills since 
1994, most recently in February. But Monday, after Shepard's death, 
Gov. Jim Geringer appealed to lawmakers to reconsider their opposition. 
``I ask for a collective suggestion for anti-bias, anti-hate legislation 
that can be presented to the Wyoming Legislature for their consideration 
in January,'' Geringer said. The governor met Monday morning with 
Dennis Shepard, the slain student's father, and said that the elder 
Shepard did not want his son's death to become ``a media circus'' 
and that ``we should not use Matt to further an agenda.'' Geringer 
said that Shepard's father also said: ``Don't rush into just passing 
all kinds of new hate-crimes laws. Be very careful of any changes 
and be sure you're not taking away rights of others in the process 
to race to this.'' Leaders of gay rights groups interviewed Monday 
said they would respect the family's privacy by not attending the 
burial in Casper, Wyo., on Saturday. But they added that they hoped 
the death would have an impact on legislators around the nation. ``Matthew's 
death, I hope, will bring about a better and deeper understanding 
of hate crime laws,'' said Elizabeth Birch, executive director of 
the Human Rights Campaign, a lesbian and gay rights group that has 
250,000 members. ``Matthew's death may lead to an awakening in Wyoming 
and in the United States Congress as the need for this legislation.'' 
In 1996, 21 men and women were killed in the United States because 
of their sexual orientation, according to the Southern Poverty Law 
Center, an Alabama group that tracks violence against minorities. 
According to the FBI, sexual orientation was a factor in 11.6 percent 
of the 8,759 hate crimes recorded in 1996. But Christian conservatives 
warn that gay leaders want to use Shepard's death to expand hate rights 
laws and to curtail freedom of speech. ``Hate crimes laws have nothing 
to do with perpetrators of violent crime and everything to do with 
silencing political opposition,'' said Steven Schwalm, an analyst 
with the Family Research Council, a Washington group dedicated to 
defending ``faith, family and freedom.'' ``It would criminalize pro-family 
beliefs,'' Schwalm said. ``This basically sends a message that you 
can't disagree with the political message of homosexual activists.'' 
Agreement came from John Paulk, who was featured this summer in a 
series of advertisements about how he and his wife, Anne, ``overcame'' 
homosexuality through religious conversion. ``We have every right 
to speak out against an agenda that is contrary to Biblical norms,'' 
said Paulk, who describes himself as a homosexuality specialist for 
Focus on the Family, a Christian group in Colorado Springs, Colo. 
``Because we are standing up and opposing the homosexual agenda, we 
are being looked upon as advocating violence against homosexuals, 
when we categorically reject violence against homosexuals.'' Last 
Thursday, the Family Research Council unveiled a series of television 
advertisements that preach the ``healing'' of homosexuality through 
religious conversion. Gay leaders charge that these advertisements 
help create a hostile climate for homosexuals, a climate that can 
lead to violence. Hate crime laws that are on the books in 40 states 
have not impinged on freedom of speech, said Brian Levin, a criminal 
justice professor who directs the Center on Hate and Extremism at 
Stockton College, in Pomona, N.J. Instead, he said, hate crime laws 
send a clear message that society does not tolerate attacks on minorities. 
``We want to deter the broken windows and simple assaults before they 
escalate,'' he said. Referring to murders of homosexuals, he added: 
``These crimes are preventable. Offenders get emboldened if they are 
not punished the first time.'' Levin said that his research indicated 
that homosexuals suffered higher rates of violent crime than the population 
at large. He also said that roughly half of the people who attack 
homosexuals are male, aged 22 or younger. ``With other crimes, violence 
is a means to an end. With hate crimes, the violence becomes an unstoppable 
goal,'' Levin said. Shepard suffered a dozen cuts around the head, 
face and neck, as well as a massive blow to the back of his skull. 
``Because their social stature in society, gays are often viewed as 
appropriate targets,'' Levin added. Citing the need for hate crime 
laws to send a clear message to gay bashers, Levin said: ``The discourse 
in society leaves many of these people to believe that what they are 
doing is socially acceptable.'' While some gay leaders saw crucifixion 
imagery in Shepard's death, others saw a different symbolism: the 
Old West practice of nailing a dead coyote to a ranch fence as a warning 
to future intruders. ``This University of Wyoming student was beaten 
and left to die, tied to a fence like an animal because he was honest 
and open about being gay,'' Beatrice Dorhn, legal director of the 
Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, said Monday, ``Matthew Shepard's 
horrible suffering and death cannot be dismissed simply as the fault 
of deranged, isolated individuals. His attackers are among millions 
of Americans who constantly hear the message that gay people are not 
worthy of the most basic equal treatment,'' Ms. Dorhn said.
