Chechen police were searching Wednesday for the bodies of four kidnapped 
foreigners who were beheaded during a botched attempt to free them. 
The deaths _ and the ostentatious display of the heads by killers 
_ prompted neighboring Russian regions to close off roads into Chechnya, 
and caused an outpouring of outrage and lament from Russian and foreign 
officials. Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said Wednesday that one 
alleged kidnapper had been arrested and authorities gleaned enough 
information to launch a rescue operation for the hostages, three Britons 
and a New Zealander. But during the rescue attempt the kidnappers 
panicked and decapitated the captives, Maskhadov said, according to 
Russian media reports. ``A concrete criminal group was identified, 
an organizer of the abductions was arrested and an approximate location 
of the hostages was determined,'' Maskhadov said in a statement. The 
severed heads of the four men were found lined up along a highway 
Tuesday outside Chechnya's capital Grozny, and hundreds of Chechen 
law enforcement officers were searching for the bodies Wednesday. 
``We will take all necessary steps to solve this horrible crime,'' 
said Maskhadov, who has been unable to restore law and order in Chechnya 
since being elected last year. The victims _ Britons Peter Kennedy, 
Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw 
_ were identified by their former bodyguard. They had been abducted 
by unidentified gunmen Oct. 3 in Grozny. ``He was just making a career 
for himself,'' Hickey's sister Deborah, 21, said Wednesday, fighting 
back tears. ``He was fantastic with electrics and all that sort of 
stuff.'' The family had expected 26-year-old Hickey to be back at 
his parents' pub in Thames Ditton, England, by Christmas. ``Everything 
was going right, everyone was very optimistic'' that the hostages 
would be rescued, she told Britain's ITV. ``The people that have done 
this to him, they deserve exactly the same back.'' The men, pickup
