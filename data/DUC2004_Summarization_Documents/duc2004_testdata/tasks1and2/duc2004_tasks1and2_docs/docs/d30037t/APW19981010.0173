Ariel Sharon's appointment as the Israeli foreign minister serves 
as ``the bullet of mercy'' for the Middle East peace process, an official 
Syrian newspaper said Saturday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
named Sharon foreign minister on Friday, effectively putting the hard-liner 
in charge of negotiating Israel's final borders with the Palestinians. 
Many Arabs know Sharon for his role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. 
An Israeli tribunal looking into the invasion found him indirectly 
responsible for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees by 
Christian Lebanese militiamen at two Beirut camps. ``Sharon's appointment 
as foreign minister is a bullet of mercy to the (peace) process, which 
has stopped on all tracks,'' said Tishrin, which often speaks for 
the Syrian government. Peace talks between Syria and Israel broke 
off more than two years ago. Syria and the previous Israeli government 
had reached an informal agreement on a full withdrawal from the Golan 
Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967. But Netanyahu's 
government rejected that agreement, saying it was never completed. 
Netanyahu has sent ``a clear message to all those who are deluding 
themselves _ and betting on Israel (to) change its anti-peace stand 
_ to give up their illusions,'' the paper said.
