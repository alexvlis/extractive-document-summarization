The case of United States vs. Microsoft Corp., the government's most 
aggressive move against a monopolist in almost 25 years, is playing 
out against a century of antitrust laws so broadly worded and court 
rulings so ambiguous that both sides are citing the same rulings to 
support their opposing arguments. Whatever the outcome of the trial, 
scheduled to begin Monday in U.S. District Court in Washington, an 
almost certain appeal will leave to the Supreme Court the task of 
bringing legal order to 100 years of clashing antitrust doctrines. 
The case focuses on Microsoft's Windows, the operating system that 
controls about 90 percent of all personal computers sold today. The 
government says its objective is to curb illegal monopolistic business 
practices that threaten to render large parts of the economy vulnerable 
to the vicissitudes of a single company. Microsoft asserts that the 
case is intended to give the government control over which features 
can be added to Windows. However grand the economic stakes, the legal 
dispute is narrow. The government says that Microsoft's contracts 
with computer manufacturers and with companies that provide access 
to the Internet illegally stifle competition. The contracts prohibit 
manufacturers from substituting Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator 
browser for Microsoft's Internet Explorer. They also prohibit them 
from removing from the Windows main screen, or desktop, links to sites 
on the World Wide Web run by Microsoft or its partners. Microsoft's 
contracts with companies that connect people to the Internet and with 
businesses that sell goods and services on the Web require favored 
treatment for Internet Explorer over Navigator in exchange for links 
on the Windows desktop. In the wake of the lawsuit, Microsoft has 
voluntarily dropped some of these requirements, though it could reinstate 
them at will. Microsoft says that its contracts are legal because 
they produce tangible benefits for customers, including easier Internet 
access. The Justice Department says that the bundling of Explorer 
with Windows 95 and the inclusion of the browser as part of Windows 
98 amount to ``tying,'' an illegal practice that forces customers 
of one product to purchase another. The contracts with manufacturers 
and Internet services are illegal, the government says, because they 
are intended not only to create a monopoly in the browser market but 
to protect Microsoft's existing monopoly in operating systems. The 
latter threat is key, according to the Justice Department. Browsers 
have the potential, like an operating system, to act as a software 
platform on which other programs run. So contracts intended to drive 
browsers out of the market would also insulate the Windows monopoly. 
Many antitrust experts say the problem facing the Justice Department 
is that the courts have provided no clear definition of tying and 
no clear guidelines for determining when contracts are illegally exclusionary. 
Professor Lawrence White of New York University, who was chief economist 
of the Justice Department's antitrust division in the early 1980s, 
says that the courts treat tying as an unusual practice when in fact 
it is ubiquitous. No one, he said, ``would challenge the right of 
manufacturers to tie erasers to the tip of pencils, tires to an automobile 
or buttons to shirts.'' His point, shared widely among economists, 
is that some tying benefits consumers if, for example, it results 
in products that are easier to use or enables a company to recover 
development costs. But tying can be bad if it locks in monopoly power. 
The courts, White says, have not offered enough guidance for distinguishing 
good tying from bad, which is the nub of the legal dispute. Microsoft 
says it needs only to show that bundling Windows and Explorer passes 
what might be called a ``gross'' consumer benefits test _ that it 
offers an immediate benefit, whether or not it causes long-term damage 
to competition and, therefore, ultimately to consumers. The Justice 
Department says that Microsoft's practices must clear a higher hurdle: 
yielding ``net'' consumer benefits that are immediate and large enough 
to balance possible long-term harm to competition. So which test of 
consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws? The simple answer is that 
no one knows for sure, which is why both sides can reasonably cite 
the same cases without fear of embarrassment. Consider a 1985 case, 
Aspen Skiing Co. vs. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., and a 1951 case, 
Lorain Journal Co. vs. United States. In the first, Aspen Skiing, 
the owner of three major ski runs in Aspen, Colo. _ the monopolist 
_ had for years sold a ticket in cooperation with Aspen Highlands, 
a competitor, that gave skiers access to both companies' runs. When 
Aspen Skiing unilaterally canceled the agreement, its rival's revenues 
shriveled and the rival sued. The Supreme Court ruled that Aspen Skiing 
had violated antitrust laws because there was no evidence its action 
helped consumers. In the Lorain Journal case, the only local newspaper 
in Lorain, Ohio, refused to sell advertising to companies that advertised 
on a new radio station. Here, too, the Supreme Court ruled that the 
exclusionary practice did nothing to benefit consumers. Indeed, in 
Aspen Skiing, the court even forced the monopolist to do business 
with its rival, a precedent that augurs well for the Justice Department, 
which seeks to force Microsoft to install Netscape's browser alongside 
its own. But Charles Rule, a legal consultant to Microsoft, says that 
in both cases the courts threw out exclusionary practices only because 
they offered no consumer benefit. The courts, he argues, never pounced 
on practices that resulted in lower prices or better products or service. 
Nor did the courts in either case call for balancing immediate benefits 
against hypothetical long-term harm. Rule argues that Microsoft's 
practices produce demonstrable consumer benefits. Besides, he says, 
unlike the actions taken by The Lorain Journal or Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's 
contracts do not prevent consumers from installing Netscape's browser 
or from using the Web sites of Microsoft's rivals. In truth, though, 
neither case answered what consumer benefit test should apply to product 
design. In Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 et al. vs. Hyde, 
another case cited by both sides, the Supreme Court in 1984 recognized 
that surgeons and anesthesiologists provide an integrated service. 
Yet, the court said, a hospital with monopoly power would still not 
be allowed to force surgical patients to use its panel of anesthesiologists 
if consumers wanted to purchase the two services separately. That 
principle could undercut Microsoft's defense that the functional interdependence 
of Windows and Explorer requires bundling. But Microsoft will point 
to a strong concurring opinion that called for a tougher standard 
for the government to meet when it alleges tying. Microsoft will also 
draw support from several court rulings that allowed IBM to change 
the design of its computers in ways that made it hard for vendors 
to attach peripheral equipment. But perhaps Microsoft's best argument 
is that nowhere has the government identified a single case in which 
the courts explicitly called for throwing out a tied product on the 
basis of a balancing test. The courts, Microsoft will emphasize, steer 
clear of redesigning technically sophisticated products. The Justice 
Department's rejoinder is to note that the sole purpose of antitrust 
law is to protect consumers, so it makes no sense to bless practices 
that provide a dollar's worth of benefits today but, by stamping out 
competition, drive prices up by $1,000 tomorrow. The Justice Department 
will ask the court to at least insist that monopolists use the least 
exclusionary means possible to achieve whatever services they provide 
customers. Experts agree that the courts will subject Microsoft's 
restrictive contracts with Internet companies to a balancing test. 
But exactly how the court will decide whether consumers are helped 
or hurt is up for grabs. A balancing test would have the courts weigh 
the immediate benefits to consumers of one-click access to Internet 
sites and of features of a bundled Windows-Explorer package versus 
the harm over time of diminished competition in the markets for browsers 
and operating systems. But a test that makes good sense in theory 
can prove fiendishly difficult to use in practice. ``Balancing tests 
are impossibly difficult and arbitrary,'' said Rep. Thomas Campbell, 
R-Calif., who is a former law professor at Stanford University. ``The 
practical effect of balancing is to hand defendants like Microsoft 
almost certain victory.'' Microsoft argues _ and many antitrust experts 
agree _ that the courts have in fact gravitated away from a balancing 
test toward a simpler ``predation'' test for exclusionary contracts. 
Under this standard, a contract is illegal only if it is intended 
to drive out competition and thus to pave the way for a monopolist 
to raise prices later. Microsoft will have an easier time defending 
itself against a charge of predation, which amounts to victimizing 
its customers, than it would defending itself against a charge that 
its bundled product does consumers slightly more harm than good. The 
antitrust record, says William Baxter, who headed the antitrust division 
under President Reagan, is littered with ``contradictory, ambiguous 
and sometimes nonsensical'' verdicts. He and other legal experts agree 
that if nothing else, that record leaves plenty of legal leeway for 
the Supreme Court, should it hear the Microsoft case, to stiffen the 
spine of the antitrust law.
