<HEADLINE> Attorney General to Seek Death Penalty in Unabomber Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno
has authorized prosecutors to seek the death penalty for Unabomber
suspect Theodore Kaczynski, Justice Department official and a
lawyer for the Kaczynski family said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Washington, D.C. attorney Anthony Bisceglie
said he had informed Kaczynski's brother David and his mother
Wanda of Reno's decision to authorize prosecutors to seek the
death penalty in the case.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski, a 54-year-old former mathematics professor, is
accused of being the Unabomber, who killed three people and
injured 23 during a campaign against technology between 1978 and
1995.
</P>
<P>
David and Wanda turned in Theodore Kaczynski last year after
authorities had mounted an unsuccessful 18-year search for the
Unabomber.
</P>
<P>
The family argued that other families in the future might be
reluctant to turn in relatives if a death sentence were imposed in
this case.
</P>
<P>
Justice Department sources said Reno agreed to prosecutors'
request and had authorized the death penalty in the case, and said
the decision was expected to be disclosed in a court filing later
on Thursday in Sacramento, California, where the case is pending.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski, arrested in Montana in April 1996, has pleaded not
guilty to the Sacramento charges accusing him of four bomb
attacks, in which two people were killed.
</P>
<P>
He faces a later trial in Newark, New Jersey, on federal
charges that he mailed a package bomb that killed advertising
executive Thomas Mosser in New Jersey. Kaczynski has also pleaded
innocent in the case.
