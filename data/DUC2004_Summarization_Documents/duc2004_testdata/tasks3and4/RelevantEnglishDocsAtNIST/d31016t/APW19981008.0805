No. 5 seed Paul Haarhuis swept past German Karsten Braasch 6-0, 6-3 
Thursday, advancing to the quarterfinals of the Shanghai Open. The 
Dutch player next meets Australian Mark Woodforde, who beat Armenia's 
Sargis Sargsian 6-2, 6-2. Sixth-seeded Ramon Delgado of Paraguay rebounded 
to beat India's Leander Paes 2-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5). Delgado's quarterfinal 
opponent will be Michael Tebbutt of Australia, who advanced after 
American Jan-Michael Gambill, the No. 3 seed, retired with a back 
injury at 5-0 in the first set. Gambill joins No. 4 seed Mikael Tillstrom 
of Sweden as the only seeded players out of competition after the 
Shanghai Open's first two rounds. In quarterfinals Friday, top-seeded 
Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia faces Denmark's Kenneth Carlsen, the No. 
7 seed, and No. 2 seed Michael Chang of the United States plays eighth-seeded 
Todd Woodbridge of Australia.
