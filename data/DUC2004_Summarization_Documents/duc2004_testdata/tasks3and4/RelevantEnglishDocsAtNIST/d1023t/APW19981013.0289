Saddam Hussein's half brother, who until recently was Iraq's ambassador 
to the United Nations in Geneva, has until early November to leave 
Switzerland, an official said Tuesday. Barzan al-Tikriti was among 
30 Iraqi ambassadors and other diplomats recalled to Baghdad over 
the summer in a major diplomatic reshuffle ordered by the Iraqi president. 
Under Swiss law, he has a ``diplomatic courtesy period'' of three 
months before leaving the country, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Monika 
Schmutz said. That expires Nov. 5, al-Tikriti having personally informed 
Vladimir Petrovsky, the head of the U.N. office in Geneva, on Aug. 
5 that he was no longer ambassador. Iraqi dissidents and Arab diplomats 
said last month al-Tikriti had refused to return to Iraq after his 
diplomatic service ended. Saddam immediately put under house arrest 
al-Tikriti's two brothers _ Sabawi, a former security chief, and Watban, 
a former interior minister _ following the defection, they said. The 
dissidents said al-Tikriti informed Arab diplomats that he refused 
to return because of his feud with Saddam's eldest son, Odai, who 
has long been groomed as the Iraqi leader's successor. But in an interview 
published Monday in the London-based Asharq Al-Awsat, al-Tikriti was 
quoted as saying that he wanted to stay on in Switzerland for family 
reasons. He did not elaborate but his wife is believed to be suffering 
from cancer and is being treated in the United States. Saddam is aware 
of his domestic problem and his desire to stay on in Switzerland, 
al-Tikriti added. He said once his family problems are over he will 
return to Iraq to ``be there next to my brother.'' ``We assume he 
is still in Switzerland,'' Schmutz said. But she had no further information, 
she added.
