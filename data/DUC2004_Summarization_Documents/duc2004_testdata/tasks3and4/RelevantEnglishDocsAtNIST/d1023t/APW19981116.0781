The wife of the half-brother of Saddam Hussein has died in Switzerland, 
officials said Monday. An official of the Iraqi embassy said he understood 
Ahlam al-Tikriti died last week. She was 44. A death notice signed 
by her husband, Barzan al-Tikriti, appeared in the London-based Arabic 
newspaper Al-Quds Al-Arabi. The notice, dated Sunday, appeared in 
Monday editions. A spokeswoman for a suburban hospital confirmed that 
she died, but declined to give the cause or say when. Mrs. al-Tikriti 
had reportedly been under treatment for breast cancer. The death is 
expected to complicate the situation of her husband, Barzan al-Tikriti, 
who last summer was ordered to return to Baghdad in a sweeping change 
of diplomatic posts. He reportedly has cited his wife's illness and 
treatment as reasons for his staying on Geneva, but has denied having 
any desire to join the Iraqi opposition. Earlier this month Iraqi 
dissidents said a cousin of Saddam failed to convince al-Tikriti to 
return home instead of going into exile. Al-Tikriti, 46,headed Iraq's 
mission at the United Nations in Geneva for 10 years. He was among 
30 Iraqi ambassadors and other diplomats recalled to Baghdad over 
the summer. Last month, Saddam's cousin, Gen. Mizahem Saab al-Hassan, 
met with al-Tikriti in Geneva and conveyed a message that his decision 
to go into exile is harming the Iraqi regime's image, said the dissidents. 
The Swiss government says al-Tikriti has until the end of November 
to leave Geneva under Swiss laws that allow U.N. diplomats to stay 
on in Switzerland for three months after the end of their tenure. 
Besides her husband, Mrs. al-Tikriti also is survived by six children, 
ranging in age from 11 to 26.
