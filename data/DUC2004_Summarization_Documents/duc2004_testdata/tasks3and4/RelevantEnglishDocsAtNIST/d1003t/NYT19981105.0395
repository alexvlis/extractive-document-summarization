The Security Council voted unanimously Thursday to condemn Iraq and 
demand that President Saddam Hussein rescind his ban on cooperation 
with United Nations arms inspectors. But the council stopped short 
of authorizing or even mentioning the use of force to back its demand. 
The resolution, making formal the outrage first expressed by council 
members on Saturday after Iraq effectively shut down the arms monitoring 
system, comes amid reports that the United States may be preparing 
for military action against Iraq. U.S. officials argue that they already 
have ample authority to attack Iraq under previous resolutions, and 
Thursday the Clinton administration moved ahead with preparations 
for air strikes, administration and Western officials said. Several 
council members, however, warned against that course. Russia's representative, 
Sergey Lavrov, who said that his government had been lobbying Iraq 
to change its policy, added that the only way out of the impasse was 
through diplomatic and political means. Nothing in Thursday's measure 
``could be interpreted arbitrarily as a kind of permission to use 
force,'' he said. ``Any attempt to resolve the problem by using force,'' 
Lavrov went on, ``would entail highly unpredictable and dangerous 
consequences both for the capacity of the United Nations to continue 
to monitor proscribed military activities in Iraq and for peace and 
stability in the region and in the Middle East as a whole.'' Brazil's 
representative, Celso Luiz Nunes Amorim, said in an interview on Wednesday 
that there was a sense among a number of council members that Iraq's 
noncompliance was not enough to provoke military action. ``If they 
did some physical damage or expelled everybody, that would be different,'' 
he said. But Thursday the Brazilian and Russian representatives joined 
a stream of speakers expressing frustration and anger over Saddam's 
seemingly self-destructive move, given the diplomatic strides Iraq 
made earlier in the year. Several diplomats speculated that the Iraqi 
President may be more out of touch or under strain than outsiders 
thought. For a year Iraq has been stepping up pressure for the lifting 
of sanctions imposed after its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, 
and the council repeatedly said this would not happen until Baghdad 
answered all outstanding questions on its weapons programs. Last week 
the Iraqi leadership said it had run out of patience. Alain Dejammet, 
the French representative, said that ``progress toward lifting sanctions 
from which the Iraqi people are suffering is for Iraq to rescind without 
delay the unjustifiable measures of Oct. 31.'' France withdrew its 
charge d'affaires from Baghdad on Thursday to protest the Iraqi bans. 
Iraq first cut back cooperation with arms inspectors on Aug. 5, then 
said on Oct. 31 that it would end all dealings with the U.N. Special 
Commission, known as Unscom, while allowing the International Atomic 
Energy Agency to continue some of its work. On Thursday, Unscom officials 
reviewed the status of their staff in Baghdad, where only maintenance 
work on monitoring equipment has been permitted. Charles Duelfer, 
deputy executive chairman of the commission, said in an interview 
that perhaps up to 20 of about 120 people might be withdrawn over 
the next few days. They would include a visiting team sent to observe 
Iraqi missile tests and some members of regular monitoring teams who 
are not needed since inspection and monitoring activities have been 
frozen. The American threat is being taken seriously among Arab leaders, 
who have urged Baghdad to rethink its harsh stand against inspections. 
A letter from the Arab League to Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq 
Aziz, Saddam's spokesman on the inspection issue, urged the Iraqis 
to adopt a ``flexible'' position, the league's representative at the 
United Nations said Thursday. ``We're very concerned about an escalation 
and the use of force to settle this problem,'' said the envoy, Hussein 
Hassouna. ``It would be better to negotiate, to convince the Iraqis 
to cooperate.'' Hassouna said that Arab nations feared that the whole 
region could be unsettled by another battering of Iraq. The resolution 
adopted Thursday restates the council's support for the special commission, 
which has been under constant attack by the Iraqi leadership. Iraq 
wants it restructured and its chairman, Richard Butler, replaced. 
But there has been little or no discussion in a week of debate about 
how to insure that meaningful inspections will take place again if 
and when Iraq lifts its ban. Arms experts, looking back over months 
of confrontations with Iraq, including another threat of U.S. military 
action almost a year ago, have watched the U.N. Special Commission, 
the panel created not only to disarm Iraq but also to prevent it from 
rearming, get whittled down further with each crisis. Getting the 
inspectors back to work, experts say, will mean more than returning 
to the status quo before August, when spot inspections were barred. 
The commission will have to be strengthened, experts say, but they 
and some members of the council add that this does not appear to be 
high on the American agenda. American diplomats here say that U.S. 
policy has not changed, but comments in recent months from administration 
officials in Washington reflect a preference for maintaining tight 
sanctions on Iraq with the unified backing of the Security Council 
rather than risking a rupture of that common front by forcing more 
intrusive policing of Iraqi arms programs. ``No inspections _ and 
sanctions _ is much worse than full inspections and diminished sanctions,'' 
said David Albright, president of the independent Institute for Science 
and International Security in Washington and a former inspector in 
Iraq for the International Atomic Energy Agency. ``My sense is that 
the U.S. government thinks that sanctions alone can do the job.'' 
Albright echoed other experts in saying that the atomic energy agency, 
which watches nuclear developments, and Unscom, which is responsible 
for checking on biological, chemical and missile programs, are at 
the critical juncture between disarming Iraq and setting up a system 
of long-term monitoring to prevent President Hussein from rearming. 
Russia, France and China have been pushing for a quicker transition 
from active, unannounced on-site inspections in Iraq to less intrusive 
long-term monitoring, which would accompany the lifting of the oil 
embargo, but not other sanctions. But arms experts, noting Iraq's 
recent stepped-up interference with monitoring activities and Baghdad's 
demands that no more on-the-spot inspections be used to back them 
up, say the value of remote inspection systems _ 135 video cameras 
in 20 locations and air, soil and water sensors and sniffers _ seems 
to have diminished considerably, if it ever was as comprehensive as 
asserted. Scott Ritter, an American specialist in Iraqi concealment 
methods who resigned from Unscom in August to protest what he called 
the Clinton administration's and Secretary-General Kofi Annan's willingness 
to muzzle inspectors, called the monitoring system ``a joke'' in an 
interview on Tuesday. ``Camera monitoring is an empty shell,'' he 
said, explaining that there had been a debate within the commission 
under Butler's predecessor, Rolf Ekeus, about where to best place 
the cameras. Ritter said he and others had argued for cameras at ``choke 
points that had easily identifiable signatures,'' like missile sites. 
Most of the cameras were instead placed haphazardly and hurriedly 
in stationary positions in storage areas or production plants, some 
watching machine tools, to the consternation of other American experts, 
he said. Iraq has learned how to work around them, he said. ``The 
United States Department of Energy itself put out a video on how easy 
it is to spoof cameras,'' he said.
