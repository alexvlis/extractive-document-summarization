Amid a boycott by opposition groups, Azerbaijan held presidential 
elections Sunday with an easy victory expected for the incumbent, 
who led his oil-rich nation during the Soviet era and retook power 
in a 1993 coup. After five hours voting, more than 31 percent of Azerbaijan's 
eligible voters had cast ballots, passing the required 25 percent 
minimum voter turnout to make the elections valid. But the main opposition 
leaders, who are boycotting the vote because they said it was unfair, 
were crying foul over the expected outcome. They criticized an announcement 
by the country's main election commission that voting results would 
not be known for four days, calling the delay a chance for the government 
to commit voter fraud. ``Whoever wins, whether it be Aliyev or someone 
else, will be illegitimate,'' said Isa Gambar, leader of the opposition 
group Musavat and former speaker of Azerbaijan's parliament. The opposition 
has long claimed that the 75-year-old Aliev, who took power in a bloodless 
1993 coup, is stacking the ballot box in his favor and has not fulfilled 
his promises to bring prosperity to Azerbaijan. The five other presidential 
contenders are close to the government and are widely believed to 
be running only to give the election the appearance of competitiveness. 
But stability that has taken hold in the country of 7.5 million once 
plagued by war and political chaos worked in Aliyev's favor Sunday. 
``I voted for Aliyev,'' said shop owner Shakhi Mamedov. ``Before he 
became the president we had instability. It was impossible to do business 
and a lot of people carried guns. But now we are moving towards a 
market economy.'' Aliyev has overseen the development of Azerbaijan's 
Caspian Sea oil fields, while other countries in the region have suffered 
from endless delays in exploiting the huge reserves. He casts himself 
as the only candidate capable of continuing the country's development 
and market reforms. In preparation for the vote, Aliyev has also tried 
to rework his authoritarian image by introducing Western-style election 
laws, abolishing media censorship and agreeing to permit limited anti-government 
rallies. ``I believe in my victory and I will be a worthy president,'' 
Aliyev said after casting his vote Sunday. ``My main task has been 
the settlement of the (Nagorno) Karabakh problem, and the strengthening 
of independence and the economy.'' Chronic corruption and sagging 
world oil prices have meant that Azerbaijan has yet to enjoy an economic 
windfall that Aliyev has been predicting for years. Unemployment remains 
high and monthly salaries rarely exceed 170,000 manat (dlrs 43). Also, 
the country's bitter dispute with Armenia over the Armenian-controlled 
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh within Azerbaijan remains unresolved. 
Aliyev ``has not done anything to return our territory,'' said Isaak 
Gamidov, a refugee from the Lachinsky district, which is occupied 
by Armenia. ``I don't care that we are very poor because the main 
thing now is to return our land, which is occupied by the enemy. On 
Friday, police blocked an opposition rally attended by about 10,000 
people in central Baku and beat several people demonstrating against 
the elections.
