Azerbaijan's recently re-elected President Geidar Aliev has chosen 
the same prime minister to lead his new government, a longtime ally 
from the Soviet era. Parliament approved Artur Rasizade's appointment 
on Friday. Aliev, who won re-election Oct. 11 in this oil-rich nation 
on the Caspian Sea, first named Rasizade prime minister in 1996. Rasizade, 
62, is an oil engineer by training. He held various Communist Party 
and government jobs in Soviet times, including deputy premier of Azerbaijan. 
Aliev, Azerbaijan's former KGB chief and later Communist Party boss, 
has ruled his country with an iron hand. The election was boycotted 
by the opposition and called undemocratic by foreign observers. Opposition 
protesters held two demonstrations in Baku on Saturday, demanding 
the cancellation of the results of the election, the Interfax news 
agency reported. One protest drew about 1,000 demonstrators; the other, 
about 5,000.
