Four journalists with an Azerbaijani opposition newspaper were injured 
Friday when they clashed with police during a protest of a libel lawsuit 
against the paper, its editor said. The head of the presidential administration, 
Ramiz Mekhtiyev, has sued the newspaper Yeni Musavat for what he said 
were articles damaging to his reputation. Dozens of employees of the 
newspaper and their supporters protested Friday outside the Supreme 
Court in Baku, capital of this former Soviet republic on the Caspian 
Sea, editor Rauf Arifogly told a news conference. Police dispersed 
the protesters, and four were injured in the clash, Arifogly said. 
He didn't give details of the injuries. Human rights groups have criticized 
Azerbaijan's authoritarian President Geidar Aliev for cracking down 
on the press, though he lifted eased censorship laws this summer ahead 
of presidential elections.
