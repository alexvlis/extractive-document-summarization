Egyptian police detained _ and sometimes tortured _ dozens of Christians 
in a town in southern Egypt in their investigation into the deaths 
of two local Christians, a human rights group said Sunday. The report, 
from the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, accused security 
forces of ``mass punishment'' of residents of the town of Al-Kushh 
in Sohag province, which is about 400 kilometers (240 miles) south 
of Cairo. Some of those detained described being hung up by their 
hands, tortured with electric shocks and beaten. Men said the police 
threatened to rape their wives and daughters if they did not provide 
information about the killings. Interior Ministry officials denied 
the reports of mass arrests and said only a few people were questioned 
after the killings. They spoke on customary condition of anonymity. 
Coptic Christians are a minority in Egypt, representing about one-sixth 
of the country's 60 million people. The government is sensitive about 
the Christians because of repeated allegations that they are treated 
as second-class citizens. Trouble in Al-Kushh _ where about three-quarters 
of the 40,000 residents are Christians _ began on Aug. 14, when the 
bodies of Samir Oweida, 25, and Karam Tamer, 27, were found in front 
of a school. The human rights group said police detained about 1,200 
people over a period of three weeks for questioning. It said that 
most of the detainees were Christian and that the police avoided interrogating 
Muslim residents of the town to avoid raising Christian-Muslim tensions. 
A Christian, Sheiboub William Artouri, was arrested and charged in 
the case, the human rights report said. Police said Artouri was with 
the victims on the night of the crime and that after they had gambled 
and gotten drunk. He allegedly shot them with a pistol, the report 
said. Among those quoted in the report was Boktor Abul-Yamin Michael, 
who was detained along with his wife and four children. He was singled 
out because of allegations that one of the victims had had an affair 
with his 15-year-old daughter. Michael told the human rights group 
he was beaten and tortured with electric shocks to ``sensitive parts'' 
of his body over 20 days of questioning by police, who tried to get 
him to admit to the murders. He said police threatened to rape his 
wife and daughters if he did not identify the killer. It said that 
relatives of the victims also were detained and tortured during the 
investigation, including William Saad, a cousin of one of the victims, 
his wife and three children. The report listed the names of a half-dozen 
families that accused the police of misconduct during the investigation. 
And it said that police extorted money from other families trying 
to avoid having loved-ones arrested. In the past, the Copts have been 
targeted by al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, the Muslim extremist group that 
has waged a campaign of violence since the spring of 1992 to try to 
overthrow Egypt's secular government and replace it with strict Islamic 
rule. Some 1,250 people have died in the violence, most of them police 
and extremists.
