Prosecutors took in a human rights activist for questioning Wednesday 
on an accusation of accepting foreign money to damage Egypt's reputation, 
but then freed him on bail. Mustafa Zeidan was the second official 
of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights to be detained over 
the group's report that police arrested hundreds of Coptic Christians 
and tortured dozens during a murder investigation in southern Egypt. 
The report caused a furor in Egypt after foreign organizations and 
some Egyptian Copts living abroad used it to support their allegation 
that the government discriminates against the Christian minority. 
The group's report had not alleged discrimination against Christians 
in the southern town of al-Kosheh, but said instead the police behavior 
was typical of practices used against Egyptians in general. Zeidan 
was questioned for a few hours before being freed on 200 Egypt pounds 
(dlrs 60) bail. The rights group's secretary-general, Hafez Abu Saada, 
was jailed for six days and released on bail on Sunday. Officials 
at the prosecutors' office said that Zeidan, who visited al-Kosheh 
to investigate the arrests, denied he wrote the report and offered 
to show prosecutors written statements from town residents complaining 
they were tortured. The prosecutors' charges are based, in part, on 
a report by Al-Osboa, an Egyptian weekly, alleging that the human 
rights group accepted a nearly dlrs 25,000 donation from the British 
Parliament as ``payment'' for their report. The group admitted it 
accepted the money but said it was for a women's legal aid program. 
It announced it would stop accepting money from foreign governments. 
The group issued a statement Wednesday vowing to fight what it said 
was a campaign ``that aims at tarnishing the organization's image 
and that of the rest of human rights groups.'' The charge of accepting 
foreign money to damage Egypt carries a prison sentence of up to 15 
years at hard labor. But it was not clear prosecutors would bring 
the case to court. The government has denied the torture allegations, 
but transferred four policeman from the town, pending an investigation. 
On Tuesday, Interior Minister Habib el-Adly accused human rights groups 
_ without naming any _ of dispersing ``false and baseless'' reports. 
Also Wednesday, a Cairo criminal court opened a trial on a 10 billion 
British pound (dlrs 16.5 billion) suit against the British newspaper 
The Telegraph for publishing an article on al-Kosheh. Mustafa Ashoub, 
a lawyer who represents 100 Copts, said the report harmed Egypt's 
image abroad. If he won the case, the money would be earmarked for 
rural development in Egypt's poor south, he added. The court postponed 
the case until Dec. 30 and asked Ashoub to provide an Arabic translation 
of the article.
