Egyptian police detained _ and sometimes tortured _ dozens of Christians 
in a town in southern Egypt in their investigation into the deaths 
of two local Christians, a human rights group said Sunday. The report 
from the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights accused security forces 
of ``mass punishment'' of residents of the town of Al-Kushh in Sohag 
province, which is about 400 kilometers (240 miles) south of Cairo. 
Some of those detained described being hung up by their hands, tortured 
with electric shocks and beaten. Men said the police threatened to 
rape their wives and daughters if they did not provide information 
about the killings. Interior Ministry officials denied the reports 
of mass arrests and said only a few people were questioned after the 
killings. They spoke on customary condition of anonymity. Coptic Christians 
are a minority in Egypt, representing about one-sixth of the country's 
60 million people. The government is sensitive about the Christians 
because of repeated allegations that they are treated as second-class 
citizens. Trouble in Al-Kushh _ where about three-quarters of the 
40,000 residents are Christians _ began on Aug. 14, when the bodies 
of Samir Oweida, 25, and Karam Tamer, 27, were found in front of a 
school. The human rights group said that in the quest by police to 
find a suspect, some 1,200 people were detained over a period of three 
weeks for questioning. It said that most of the detainees were Christian 
and that the police avoided interrogating Muslim residents of the 
town to avoid raising Christian-Muslim tensions. In the end a Christian, 
Sheiboub William Artouri, was arrested and charged in the case, the 
human rights report said. Police said Artouri was with the victims 
on the night of the crime and that after they had gambled and gotten 
drunk, he allegedly shot them with a pistol, the report said. The 
human rights group alleged that in its quest for a suspect, the police 
rounded up whole families _ including women and children. Among those 
quoted in the report was Boktor Abul-Yamin Michael, who was detained 
along with his wife and four children. He was singled out because 
of allegations that one of the victims had had an affair with his 
15-year-old daughter. Michael told the human rights group he was beaten 
and tortured with electric shocks to ``sensitive parts'' of his body 
over 20 days of questioning by police, who tried to get him to admit 
to the murders. He said police threatened to rape his wife and daughters 
if he did not identify the killer. It said that relatives of the victims 
also were detained and tortured during the investigation, including 
William Saad, a cousin of one of the victims, his wife and three children. 
The report listed the names of a half-dozen families that accused 
the police of misconduct during the investigation. And it said that 
police extorted money from other families trying to avoid having loved-ones 
arrested. Similar allegations of police abuse in Al-Kushh were reported 
in the current edition of the biweekly Cairo Times. The newspaper 
interviewed more than 50 residents of the town, who described police 
seizing residents at a rate of 50 or 60 a day for questioning. ``Most 
of the interviewees had scars on their backs (allegedly from whips 
and electrodes), hands and toes (from electrodes) or wrists (from 
manacles),'' the paper said. It said 14 people were seriously enough 
injured during interrogations to require hospitalization. In the past, 
the Copts have been targeted by al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, the Muslim extremist 
group that has waged a campaign of violence since the spring of 1992 
to try to overthrow Egypt's secular government and replace it with 
strict Islamic rule. Some 1,250 people have died in the violence, 
most of them police and extremists.
