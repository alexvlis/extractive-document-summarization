Seven Egyptian human rights groups appealed Sunday to President Hosni 
Mubarak to ensure that police officers they accuse of torturing hundreds 
of Christian Copts be brought to justice. In a statement faxed to 
The Associated Press, the groups also urged Interior Minister Habib 
el-Adly and other police officials to apologize for the torture, which 
reportedly took place in a southern Egyptian town. ``They should apologize 
to the Egyptian public opinion for the harm inflicted to the Egyptians 
and to the country's reputation,'' said the statement signed by the 
seven groups. The alleged torture in the largely Christian town of 
al-Kusheh has caused an uproar, with Egyptian officials denying discrimination 
against the Coptic Christian minority and charging that media reports 
on the subject have been aimed at maligning Egypt. One group signing 
the statement was the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, which 
originally reported that police had arrested hundreds of Christians 
and tortured scores of them in seeking a killer in the southern town 
last August. The group maintained that police feared the culprit was 
Muslim but were anxious to find a Christian suspect to avoid any religious 
strife in the town. It said the incident was an example of typical 
police torture, aimed in the past at Muslims, too. The government 
has repeatedly denied any torture took place and said only 14 people 
were detained in al-Kusheh, which is 400 kilometers (245 miles) south 
of Cairo. After the arrest in August, several villagers from al-Kusheh 
showed an Associated Press reporter scars on their arms and other 
parts of the body that they said were inflicted during police questioning. 
There was no immediate comment from Mubarak's office on the statement 
Sunday by the Egyptian rights groups. The groups have been involved 
in a long battle with the government over getting the proper licenses 
needed to do their work. Sunday's statement also blamed el-Adly for 
waiting three months before he launched an investigation into the 
incidents in al-Kusheh. He was quoted by the state-run El-Gomhuria 
as saying Sunday that the reports about al-Kusheh were exaggerated, 
but that he would punish any officers involved if police wrongdoing 
was proven.
