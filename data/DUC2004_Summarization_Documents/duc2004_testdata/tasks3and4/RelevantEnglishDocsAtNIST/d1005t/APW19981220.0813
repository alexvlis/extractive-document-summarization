The impeachment vote against U.S. President Bill Clinton made headlines 
around the world Sunday, though most governments remained silent on 
the political turmoil in the United States. The U.S. House of Representatives 
impeached Clinton on Saturday for obstructing justice and lying under 
oath about his sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky and voted largely 
along party lines to send his case to the Senate for a trial. Government 
leaders elsewhere were reluctant to make public statements about the 
impeachment, saying it was an internal matter for America. Philippine 
Pres. Joseph Estrada, who has faced allegations of womanizing in the 
past, declined to respond to questions about it and British Prime 
Minister Tony Blair, a staunch ally of Clinton's, said it would not 
be right for him to comment. But Blair said he had ``nothing but contempt'' 
for suggestions that the U.S.-British bombing raid on Iraq was timed 
to divert attention away from the impeachment. ``I find it utterly 
grotesque and offensive, not just to President Clinton, but to me, 
that anyone could suggest we would put British or American servicemen 
or women into action because of any internal matter in the United 
States of America,'' Blair said. But in France, Jack Lang, president 
of the Foreign Affairs Commission in the National Assembly, reaffirmed 
his long-standing support of Clinton, saying the U.S. president has 
been ``the victim of a witch hunt from another era.'' The House of 
Representatives has ``just offered the world a festival of hypocrisy,'' 
he said, adding that the proceedings had been a ``parody of justice'' 
and a ``sectarian fundamentalism'' that risks destabilizing a great 
democracy. The South Korean state-run news agency, Yonhap, said it 
was a ``very unhappy day for President Bill Clinton and the United 
States.'' It urged Clinton to apologize for his ``lies'' to defuse 
the political crisis and prevent instability not only within the United 
States, but worldwide. In some countries' newspapers, opinion on the 
impeachment divided along political lines with left-wing papers attacking 
Republicans and conservative papers demanding Clinton's resignation 
and replacement by Vice-President Al Gore. ``It's time to show Bill 
the door and say hello to Gore,'' said an editorial in Britain's biggest 
selling tabloid, the News of the World, which is owned by media tycoon 
Rupert Murdoch. The Observer, a London-based left-wing broadsheet, 
said impeachment was ``a tragedy for the U.S. and the world,'' but 
sympathized with Democrats who believed that the vote was ``an attempted 
constitutional coup d'etat by the Republicans.'' There was no official 
reaction in Mexico, one of America's partners in the North American 
Free Trade Agreement and a country heavily affected by U.S. politics. 
Newspapers universally made impeachment their lead story, with columnists 
portraying the issue as a political conflict rather than an issue 
of law. ``In Latin America it is a joke that a president could be 
judged for an extramarital affair,'' said the centrist Cronica newspaper. 
A German newspaper lamented the loss of American prestige due to the 
scandal. Calling the impeachment vote ``horrible theater,'' the Berliner 
Morgenpost daily newspaper said in a Sunday editorial that the Lewinsky 
affair had ``poisoned the political climate of the United States'' 
and damaged the country's standing abroad. In Turin, Italy, La Stampa 
ran an unusually large closeup of Clinton's face. ``These eyes, red 
and humiliated, those heavy bags under the eyes, that ashen complexion, 
are the tragic testimony to the humiliation of a young leader, William 
Jefferson Clinton, the Democrat who stopped the 12-year-hegemony of 
the Republicans in the White House, the man who had relaunched the 
hopes of a reasoning left in all the world,'' wrote columnist Gianni 
Riotta, a former U.S.-based foreign correspondent. The impeachment 
story shared headlines with airstrikes on Iraq in the mass-selling 
Swiss German SonntagsBlick newspaper ``From now on, only saints can 
be president,'' it said in a report criticizing Republican behavior.
