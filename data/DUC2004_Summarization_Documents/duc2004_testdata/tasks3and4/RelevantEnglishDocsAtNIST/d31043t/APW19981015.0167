Parliament on Thursday formally elected Gen. Emile Lahoud, the popular 
army commander who has the backing of powerful neighbor Syria, as 
Lebanon's next president. All the 118 legislators present at the session 
cast votes in his favor. Lahoud is to be sworn in for a six-year term 
on Nov. 24, the day President Elias Hrawi leaves office.
