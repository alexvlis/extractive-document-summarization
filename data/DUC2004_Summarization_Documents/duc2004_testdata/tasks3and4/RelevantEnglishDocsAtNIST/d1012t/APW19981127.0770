King Hussein said Friday he may return home in early January after 
a sixth and final round of chemotherapy treatment for cancer. It was 
the first time Jordanians had heard of a return date for Hussein, 
63, who has been in the United States since July 13 to receive treatment 
for non-Hodgkins lymphoma. ``I expect I will return to my beloved 
home either in late December or early January,'' the king said in 
a letter to Zeid Rifai, speaker of the Upper House of Parliament. 
Last week, the king assured his people that five rounds of chemotherapy 
at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, have completely cured 
him. But he said he would undergo a marrow transplant in late November 
to ensure that the cancer will not recur. In his letter to Rifai, 
which was carried by the state-run Petra News Agency, Hussein said 
the operation would be carried out next week. The king said that during 
the transplant, he would be confined to bed and ``not allowed to receive 
visitors because of the diminished immunity level as result of chemical 
treatment.'' Petra said the letter was in response to affirmations 
of loyalty expressed by both houses of Parliament last week _ a constitutional 
formality if the king is out of the country for more than four months. 
It is the first time the king has been absent for so long since he 
ascended to the throne at the age of 17 in 1953.
