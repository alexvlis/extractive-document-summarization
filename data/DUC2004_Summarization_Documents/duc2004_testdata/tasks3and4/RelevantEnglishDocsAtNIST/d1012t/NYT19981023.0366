He was drawn and pale, left bald by repeated courses of chemotherapy. 
He had no substantive inducements to offer the Israelis or the Palestinians. 
But in the end, all the parties to the negotiations said, King Hussein 
of Jordan, the longest-serving leader in the Middle East, played a 
critical role in bringing the two sides together. It was the latest 
and perhaps one of the final chapters in his long history of coaxing 
the Arab world and Israel to accommodation if not peace, and it cast 
him as conscience to the region. The king's ``courage, commitment, 
wisdom and frankly, stern instruction at appropriate times were at 
the heart of this success,'' President Clinton said at the signing 
ceremony Friday. ``He reminded us of what rises above the facts, the 
arguments, the legitimate interests, even the painful sacrifices involved,'' 
Clinton said of the Jordanian leader, who joined the talks after finishing 
a round of cancer treatments at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota last 
weekend. ``He was the living embodiment of the best of our past and 
the brightest of our hopes for the future.'' The king, who is 62 and 
has ruled Jordan since 1952, had delivered an emotional plea to the 
Israeli and Palestinian delegations on Thursday evening, and repeated 
the same message publicly Friday at the White House as Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, prepared 
to sign the agreement. The king joked about the loss of his hair and 
eyebrows to chemotherapy, and said that although many people have 
written him off because of his illness, his morale is the best it 
has ever been. He has non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and just completed the 
fourth of six scheduled rounds of chemotherapy. ``If I had an ounce 
of strength, I would have done my utmost to be there and to help in 
any way I can,'' he said. ``We quarrel, we agree, we are friendly, 
we are not friendly, but we have no right to dictate through irresponsible 
action or narrow-mindedness the future of our children or their children's 
children,'' the king said, turning to face Netanyahu and Arafat. ``There 
has been enough destruction, enough death, enough waste, and it's 
time that together we occupy a place beyond ourselves, our peoples, 
that is worthy of them under the sun, the descendants of the children 
of Abraham _ Palestinians and Israelis coming together.'' Hussein, 
who witnessed the 1951 assassination of his grandfather, King Abdullah, 
by a Palestinian who feared that Jordan was about to make a separate 
peace with Israel, said Friday's agreement would not bring an end 
to violence in the Middle East. ``I think that such a step as is concluded 
Friday will inevitably trigger those who want to destroy life, destroy 
hope, create fear in the hearts and minds of people, trigger in them 
their worst instincts,'' the king said. ``Let's hope that the overwhelming 
majority of us, those who are committed to the future, those who know 
what responsibilities they hold now, will be able, through steady 
progress and a determined joint combined effort, be able to thwart 
their aims.'' Hussein has long played a critical role in efforts to 
bring peace to the region, and was involved in each of the last several 
breakthroughs. But he came to his role as peacemaker after fighting 
Israel, violently expelling the Palestine Liberation Organization 
from Jordan in 1970 and opposing the United States in the Persian 
Gulf war. And he has had a tense relationship with Netanyahu, whom 
he said two years ago seemed intent on scuttling the peace process. 
But before he left the Mayo Clinic, the king received a visit last 
Friday from Ariel Sharon, the hard-line Israeli foreign minister. 
Then, as negotiations bogged down earlier this week, the king joined 
the talks at Wye Plantation in Maryland at several points, both in 
person and by telephone. Friday, the king stood alongside Clinton 
at the White House, the two of them flanked by Netanyahu and Arafat. 
And even Netanyahu paid tribute to Hussein, saying the Jordanian leader's 
two appearances at the Wye Plantation negotiations ``gave us an unforgettable 
and inspiring example of courage and humanity, and it moved me deeply.''
