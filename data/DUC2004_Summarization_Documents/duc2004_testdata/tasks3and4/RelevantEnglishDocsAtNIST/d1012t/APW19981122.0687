On a cold day in October, King Hussein and Queen Noor bundled up in 
blankets and stole a few minutes from the tortuous Middle East negotiations 
at Maryland's Wye Plantation to watch migrating geese land nearby 
as the sun set. A banal moment, the American-born queen admits, but 
one that was all the more poignant because it came as Jordan's royal 
couple grappled with their most daunting personal challenge in 20 
years of married life: the king's struggle with cancer. Sitting in 
the couple's family room at their residence in suburban Maryland, 
the queen said in an interview with The Associated Press and Associated 
Press Television News that her husband's illness has given her a new 
perspective on life. ``There is no question that each moment of life 
is even more precious than ever before,'' Noor said. ``Any life-threatening 
situation highlights ... the importance that you place on every aspect 
of life and every moment of the life of your loved ones.'' The king 
and queen have been in the United States since July, when Hussein 
disclosed that he has non-Hodgkins lymphoma. After months of treatment 
and chemotherapy at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, his cancer 
is in complete remission. Noor said she and her husband expect to 
return to Jordan early next year, after Hussein undergoes a marrow 
transplant to guard against recurrence of the lymphoma. Like any cancer 
survivor, Hussein, who has lost his hair to chemotherapy and looked 
frail at Wye, will continue to be monitored. Asked whether the cancer 
has been beaten, Noor said the doctors would not say, ``nor would 
we say now, ... that he's completely cured, but we hope and pray that 
this is the case.'' Unlike many Arabs, Hussein has been quite forthcoming 
about his cancer, normally a taboo subject in the Middle East. He 
has appeared several times on Jordanian television to keep his people 
informed about his condition. Noor said she hoped the king ``will 
have dispelled some of the fear and anxiety that accompanies cancer 
... by being so open about it and about the struggle that he's undertaken 
to beat it.'' Hussein's absence, the longest period a Jordanian king 
has ever been away from home, sparked so much frenzied gossip in mid-August 
about a successor that the king had to deny from his hospital room 
rumors that he was dying. Hussein, who celebrated his 46th anniversary 
as Jordan's monarch this year, has named his brother Hassan as successor. 
But rumors have abounded that the royal family is riven by dissension 
over the issue and that Noor is maneuvering for her eldest son to 
be chosen king. Hussein has eight children from three previous marriages 
and two boys and two girls from his marriage to Noor. Noor called 
the gossip ``just opportunistic exploitation of his illness'' and 
said succession and transition ``will take place in their own time.'' 
``His majesty ... has worked very hard over the years to ensure that 
the Hashemite family will serve the country in the smoothest and most 
capable fashion,'' said Noor, 47. On a more personal note, the queen 
said the cancer ordeal has highlighted ``just how important we are 
to each other as well.'' Even as he battled cancer, the king was asked 
by Israeli and Palestinian negotiators last month to fly to the Wye 
Plantation on Maryland's Eastern Shore to help settle a deal on an 
Israeli pullout from the West Bank. President Bill Clinton said the 
king's influence was crucial to the agreement that emerged. The quiet 
moment the king and queen shared at Wye was depicted a few weeks later 
on a birthday cake for Hussein's 63rd birthday on Nov. 14. The two 
were ``looking at the end of a difficult day with a promise of a new 
day,'' said Noor. ``The scene ... seemed to represent a very special 
moment in the course of his treatment and in the course of this political 
struggle.'' The queen too has been active during her U.S. stay, honoring 
appointments at the United Nations and in Washington, where she grew 
up. Noor was present for the inauguration of the capital's new Peace 
Corps headquarters in September with Hillary Rodham Clinton, with 
whom the queen said she enjoys ``a very sisterly relationship.'' Noor 
is also an active opponent to the use of land mines and a campaigner 
for ecotourism. In addition, the queen _ an Arab-American Christian 
by birth _ has been fighting hard to dispel misconceptions about Islam 
and Arabs. But she said her training in architecture and urban planning 
at Princeton University, which involved long hours, prepared her for 
the demanding life of a queen. Noor was working on an airport design 
project in Jordan when she met the king. The former Lisa Halaby adopted 
the Islamic religion and took the name Noor al Hussein, or ``Light 
of Hussein,'' when they were married in 1978.
