Jordan threw a 63rd birthday party during the weekend for King Hussein, 
who could not attend but said that he is completely cured of the cancer 
he has been battling for the last four months at the Mayo Clinic in 
Minnesota. The announcement by the king, made in a television interview 
on Friday night, was greeted with joy at celebrations around Jordan, 
where the king's birthday is a two-day national holiday. Information 
Minister Nasser Joudeh said that Hussein was likely to return to Jordan 
at the end of December. A separate statement by the king's physicians, 
published in the Jordan Times on Saturday, described the king as being 
``in complete remission from lymphoma,'' which was diagnosed in July. 
But the doctors said that as ``standard procedure'' they still intended 
to carry out a marrow transplant later this month to ensure that no 
traces of the cancer returned. Since he began his treatment, the king 
has undergone five separate rounds of chemotherapy, which have caused 
him to lose weight and most of his hair. When he appeared in public 
late last month at a White House signing ceremony for the Wye peace 
agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, his gaunt appearance 
shocked people accustomed to a far more vital figure. In the king's 
absence, his younger brother, Crown Prince Hassan, has acted as the 
country's leader, in what by most accounts has been a reassuring preview 
of how the country might be governed if the king's 45-year-reign comes 
to an end. Still, both the signs of Hussein's ill health and his long 
absence have unnerved many Jordanians, the majority of whom have never 
known any other king. Even as they adorned the capital, Amman, this 
week with flags and banners expressing birthday wishes and hopes for 
the king's safe return, some Jordanians said they feared that he might 
never come back. For that reason, the king's announcement Friday night 
that he expected to be ``amongst you in the near future'' was greeted 
here Sunday with almost audible relief.
