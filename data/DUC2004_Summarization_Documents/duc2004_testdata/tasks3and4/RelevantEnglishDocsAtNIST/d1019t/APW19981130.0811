Millions of Syrians headed to the polls Monday to elect a new 250-seat 
Parliament from among 7,350 candidates, though the majority of seats 
are reserved for the ruling coalition. ``There is an excellent turnout,'' 
said Kheir Eddin Nakhleh, head of a polling station in Damascus. ``I 
hope that the candidates will meet their promises made to the people.'' 
Results were not expected before Thursday. The National Assembly, 
or parliament, has limited legislative power, with effective control 
held by President Hafez Assad, who came to power in a bloodless coup 
in 1970. Two-thirds of the seats are allotted to the National Progressive 
Front, a coalition of seven parties led by the Baath Party which has 
ruled Syria since 1963. The allotment of seats was the same in the 
previous four-year term, which ended in September. The Baath gets 
135 seats, and 32 go to allied parties. Independents run for the remaining 
83 seats. Syrian Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam told reporters 
as he cast his vote that taking part in the election ``is a national 
duty.''
