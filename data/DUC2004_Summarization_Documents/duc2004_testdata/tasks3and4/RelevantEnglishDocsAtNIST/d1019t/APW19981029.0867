Campaigning began Thursday for Syria's parliamentary elections next 
month, with candidates putting up posters and banners in the streets 
of this capital city. Interior Minister Mohammed Haraba said 7,364 
candidates were running for the 250-seat parliament. By the socialist-oriented 
constitution, 127 seats must go to persons from the working class. 
Businessmen and industrialists are expected to have more say in the 
parliament to be elected on Nov. 30. The influence of these groups 
has increased with the government's efforts to encourage investment. 
The polls are expected to be won by the National Progressive Front, 
a coalition of seven parties led by the Baath Party which has ruled 
Syria since 1963. Parliamentary elections are held every four years. 
The assembly has some legislative power, but effective control is 
held by President Hafez Assad, who came to power in a bloodless coup 
in 1970.
