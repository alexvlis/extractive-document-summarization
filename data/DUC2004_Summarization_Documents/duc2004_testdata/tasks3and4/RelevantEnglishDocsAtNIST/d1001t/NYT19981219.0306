The United States and Britain ended their attack on Iraq Saturday 
night after carrying out a fourth day of air and missile strikes as 
the holy month of Ramadan began in the Islamic world. President Clinton, 
appearing at the White House only hours after the House voted to impeach 
him, called off the campaign at 6 p.m. ET, or 2 a.m. Sunday in Iraq. 
Clinton declared the attack a success but warned that the United States 
and Britain would strike Iraq again if President Saddam Hussein took 
any steps to rebuild chemical or biological weapons or threaten his 
neighbors. ``I am confident we have achieved our mission,'' Clinton 
said, appearing in the Roosevelt Room with his senior national security 
aides. ``We have inflicted significant damage on Saddam's weapons 
of mass destruction programs, on the command structures that direct 
and protect that capability and on his military and security infrastructure.'' 
Iraq, battered but unbowed, reacted with defiance. Its vice president, 
Taha Yassin Ramadan, on Saturday declared an end to its cooperation 
with U.N. weapons inspections, imposed as part of conditions for ending 
the Persian Gulf war in 1991. Although not unexpected after the U.S. 
and British attack, the declaration means that the United States has 
entered a new phase in its 7-year-old standoff with Saddam. In the 
wake of the strikes, Clinton once again called for a new government 
in Baghdad, as did Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain in London, 
though both had stopped short of making that an objective of the bombing 
campaign, knowing that to do so would invite failure. Still, Clinton 
said the United States would work to maintain Saddam's diplomatic 
isolation and increase support for opposition groups that might someday 
overthrow him. ``Over the long term, the best way to end the threat 
that Saddam poses to his own people and the region is for Iraq to 
have a different government,'' he said. From the outset of the bombing 
on Wednesday night, Clinton and Blair said they were sensitive to 
carrying out strikes against an Arab country during the Muslims' month 
of fasting and religious study. On Saturday night they said the campaign 
had always been meant to last nearly four days, even though that pushed 
it into Ramadan. And so as night fell in Iraq Saturday, antiaircraft 
fire once again burst over Baghdad, in reaction to one last day of 
strikes. Saturday's attack included still more Tomahawk cruise missiles 
and American and British fighters and bombers, though it was far smaller 
than the thunderous barrage of 150 strikes that battered Iraq on Friday 
night. Throughout the four-day campaign, the Pentagon methodically 
hit, in wave after wave, targets selected after months of study as 
the best hope of damaging Iraq's ability to make and use nuclear, 
chemical and biological weapons. To that end, the attacks concentrated 
on command centers, missile factories and airfields. The campaign 
also hit an oil refinery Saddam allegedly used to evade sanctions 
and the headquarters and bases of the Republican Guard, the force 
that helps maintain Saddam's grip on power. ``From the beginning of 
this operation, we've been careful to set realistic goals,'' Secretary 
of Defense William Cohen said at the Pentagon Saturday before the 
campaign was called off. ``We've also been careful not to either overstate 
or exaggerate the results as our intelligence analysts study the very 
preliminary data.'' Cohen stressed ``that this military action is 
substantial.'' Offering the first concrete measure of the assault's 
impact on Iraq's power, he said Saddam's ballistic missile program 
had been set back ``by at least a year.'' A senior military commander, 
who spoke on condition of anonymity, agreed Saturday that the attacks 
had ``certainly set back'' Iraq's military, but conceded that it was 
difficult to quantify that. And it remains unclear that military successes 
alone can do much to advance the administration's longer-term strategy 
of containing Saddam. A day after disclosing that the first strikes 
had severely damaged or destroyed only a part of their targets, the 
Pentagon said Saturday that American and British forces had struck 
100 targets with about 450 sea- and air-launched cruise missiles and 
650 sorties by fighters, bombers and support aircraft. And Cohen and 
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton of the 
Army, offered a more optimistic view of the damage done. Of 74 targets 
whose damage has been surveyed in photographs from spy planes or satellites, 
they said 28 had been severely damaged or destroyed. Many targets, 
they emphasized, received ``moderate damage,'' which Cohen sought 
to describe by saying that the Alfred Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma 
had, militarily, been ``moderately damaged'' by the car bomb three 
years ago.
