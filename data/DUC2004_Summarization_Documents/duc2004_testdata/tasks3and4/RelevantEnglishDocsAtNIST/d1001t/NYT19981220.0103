In a tough-talking assessment of the air attacks on Iraq, Prime Minister 
Tony Blair Sunday urged doubters and critics to understand the new 
``global reality'' that modern diplomacy must be backed up by force. 
``I recognize that not everyone around the world has welcomed this 
action,'' he said in an apparent reference to the angry reactions 
of China and Russia and the unsettled response from European allies 
like France and Italy. ``But I believe at heart that most know its 
necessity.'' Saying he was determined to build a broad consensus on 
dealing with Iraq, Blair added that even countries that had withheld 
approval and support for the campaign ``fully accept that Saddam has 
to be watched, has to be contained and that the whole of the world 
community has to be engaged in that process.'' Blair, leader of the 
only country to join the United States in the four days of air strikes, 
used a televised address Sunday not just to list the mission's accomplishments 
but to put forth an earnest justification of the raids and the need 
to be prepared to stage more in the future. Britain, he announced, 
is sending the aircraft carrier Invincible to the Persian Gulf to 
reinforce its Tornado jets based in Kuwait. The ship will arrive in 
late January at the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. ``The 
sending of the aircraft carrier is a very big signal that we are not 
going away,'' said George Robertson, the British defense minister, 
who appeared at the briefing with Blair, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook 
and Gen. Sir Charles Guthrie, chief of the British defense staff. 
Blair said he saw no need for any new U.N. authorization to strike 
Iraq in the future, and he turned aside talk of easing sanctions, 
saying that the program should instead be ``as rigorous as we can 
make it.'' He pledged to intercept more traffic in the gulf, arguing 
that it was being used by Saddam Hussein to circumvent sanctions. 
Blair said the objective now was to contain Saddam, and he used a 
metaphor that he has employed all week, saying the Iraqi leader must 
be kept ``in his cage.'' He rejected the argument that this policy 
was a poor substitute for eliminating Saddam entirely. ``I do not 
accept it for an instant,'' he said. ``Just because we can't get in 
the cage and strike him down, it doesn't mean we should leave the 
cage untouched and the bars too fragile to hold him. What we have 
done is put him back firmly in the cage and secure it.'' Of the achievements 
of the bombing campaign, the two that Blair and the officials cited 
most frequently were the destruction of hangars that they said house 
pilotless drone planes designed to spray deadly anthrax, and the bombings 
of barracks and a brigade headquarters of the Republican Guard that 
protects Saddam. Sir Charles showed film of both strikes. Blair acknowledged 
that it was unlikely that U.N. weapons inspectors would be permitted 
back into the country. Unless Iraq showed a ``completely different 
order of readiness'' to cooperate, he said, the focus would now be 
on the proven threat of force and heightened aerial surveillance to 
compensate for the absence of the U.N. monitors. ``We will know what 
is happening, and whether Saddam is yet again getting into a position 
to threaten others,'' Blair said. ``If he is, he knows what to expect.'' 
He said Britain would ``continue to engage with the Iraqi opposition 
to help them develop their vision of a better Iraq.'' Many of the 
groups are based in London. Aware of the upset caused in Britain's 
growing Muslim population, Blair said the operation was structured 
from the beginning to end in four days so as not to intrude on the 
festival of Ramadan. The government's chief civil rights official, 
Home Office Minister Mike O'Brien, is meeting Monday with British 
Muslim leaders to discuss their worries about the air campaign. Blair 
lashed out at the theory that the timing of the strikes had been predicated 
on President Clinton's desire to forestall impeachment. Calling such 
suggestions ``grotesque and offensive,'' he said, ``I would never 
commit British servicemen and women unless I thought it was necessary.'' 
At home and in Europe, Blair has had to defend himself against assertions 
that he is too obedient to Washington, and he and Cook have been in 
frequent contact with continental leaders explaining Britain's position. 
Leader of a party that once espoused pacifism and regularly denounced 
U.S. big-power actions abroad, Blair found himself last week in the 
unaccustomed role of leading war-room sessions with uniformed officers 
and conducting a joint military operation with the United States. 
Most of the domestic criticism has come from members of his own party. 
The Labor-friendly Independent on Sunday said that it was ``dispiriting 
that Tony Blair should prove such an uncritical and servile supporter 
of the president,'' while the conservative Sunday Telegraph found 
the airstrikes ``logical and entirely justified.'' Washington has 
welcomed the prime minister's eagerness to articulate the mission's 
objectives, allowing him to speak to the world first on Wednesday 
in a televised announcement of the mission from in front of 10 Downing 
St. before Clinton gave his address from the Oval Office. Blair said 
Britain planned an ``intensive diplomatic process'' with other U.N. 
Security Council members, Arab nations and other European countries 
``to forge a new strategy for stability in relations between the international 
community and Iraq.'' On Monday, Cook is to meet in London with Joschka 
Fischer, the new German foreign minister, to discuss how Europe can 
get aid to the needy in Iraq. On Saturday, Cook opened a new front 
in the war for obtaining public backing for the campaign with a televised 
briefing devoted to outlining the dimensions of the ``extraordinary 
evil'' that Saddam represents. He cited Amnesty International reports 
detailing what he called a systematic program of torture, executions 
and mass murder that the Iraqi president uses to enforce his power. 
``He runs a terror state,'' Cook said. ``As and when Saddam goes, 
and when evidence of that terror state becomes more widely known and 
publicized by those who replace him, the world will ask why was it 
that we were in any doubt about the nature of the regime and why there 
was any hesitation about standing up to him.''
