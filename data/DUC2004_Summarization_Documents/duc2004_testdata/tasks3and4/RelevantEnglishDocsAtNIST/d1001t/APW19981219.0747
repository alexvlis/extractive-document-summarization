Iraq's vice president declared Saturday that the Baghdad regime will 
end all dealings with the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees 
weapons inspections, in response to the American and British air strikes. 
Taha Yassin Ramadan made the statement shortly before a half-dozen 
loud blasts rocked the capital, indicating that the fourth wave of 
punishing missile strikes was under way as Iraqis broke their first 
day of fasting for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Witnesses said 
that three missiles struck near Al-Mustansiriya University in central 
Baghdad and that smoke could be seen rising from the area. It was 
not immediately clear what the missiles hit. Trails of smoke also 
could be seen rising from a building near the city's center. Iraq 
has been taking a beating since overnight Wednesday-Thursday, when 
U.S. and British forces launched an air offensive to punish the regime 
of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein for obstructing the work of U.N. 
weapons inspectors. In Washington, Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said about 90 targets had been struck in 
Iraq so far and that some were hit more than once. ``I am very pleased 
by the result of our strikes,'' he said. Defense Secretary William 
Cohen, meanwhile, said the missiles had inflicted ``significant damage.'' 
He declined to say when the campaign would end, saying: ``It will 
stop when the president orders it to stop.'' Ramadan told a news conference 
that ``the Special Commission is now behind us. Its mission is over.'' 
He repeated Iraq's allegation that UNSCOM was a tool of the Americans, 
adding: ``Its only mission in Iraq now is to find a cover for the 
genitals of those who want to carry out aggression against Iraq.'' 
The implications of an Iraqi decision to shut down U.N. inspections 
are grave. UNSCOM is charged with eliminating Iraq's chemical and 
biological weapons as well as long-range missiles. It also is responsible 
for setting up a long-range monitoring program to ensure that Iraq 
doesn't rebuild its lethal arsenal. Destruction of the weapons was 
mandated by the U.N. Security Council resolutions that ended the 1991 
Gulf War. Those same resolutions state that the inspectors must certify 
that Iraq is free of its banned weapons before the council will lift 
economic sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. 
Before the vice president began speaking, gun batteries on rooftops 
sent tracer shells streaking across the sky shortly after sundown. 
Sirens wailed a warning for citizens to take cover. The previous attack 
ended shortly before dawn on Saturday and had appeared to be the toughest 
yet against Baghdad. Ramadan declined to give casualty figures, but 
said that the number of civilians killed ``was 10 times more than 
military men.'' He said that 12 students died and many more were wounded 
Friday night when a missile hit a dormitory in the northern province 
of Tameem. The government said earlier that 25 people were killed 
and 75 injured in the first two nights of attacks. On Saturday, the 
state-run Iraqi News Agency said five more people died and 21 were 
wounded in a missile attack on the Al-Riyad neighborhood of the northern 
town of Kirkuk. The United States says the aim of Operation Desert 
Fox is to lessen Iraq's ability to make weapons of mass destruction, 
threaten its neighbors and attack U.S. interests in the region. But 
Ramadan repeated Iraq's contention that the real goal was to eliminate 
Saddam. ``I am telling those who were promised the elimination of 
our great leader that the symbol of the nation, its lofty example, 
will remain,'' Ramadan said. He added: ``We will fight to the last 
citizen, and history will glorify us.'' Baghdad residents said damage 
from the missile attacks late Friday and early Saturday was heavy 
and that a number of buildings in the center of the capital _ including 
palaces, security headquarters and offices of the ruling Baath Party 
_ had been hit. The walls of the Military Industrialization Corporation, 
which oversees state-run factories, were still standing, but the building 
appeared to have been gutted by missiles. The official Iraqi News 
Agency said a missile had damaged an historic Abbasid palace in Baghdad, 
parts of which date to the year 1180. Ramadan focused on civilian 
sites that were hit, confirming earlier reports that telephone communications 
with southern provinces had been broken. He also charged that the 
United States and Britain had hit an electricity plant and destroyed 
a factory that had been inspected by UNSCOM. In London, British officials 
showed videotapes of bomb hits on Republican Guard facilities in southern 
Iraq, and emphasized that Saddam's top guards were a key target of 
the operation. ``Those are the people that surround him, keep him 
in office, have their own system of repression, and of course have 
been instrumental in putting together the means of concealing the 
weapons of mass destruction,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair said. In 
a radio address from the White House, U.S. President Bill Clinton 
told listeners ``I believe the mission is going well.'' He added: 
``Where do we go from here? We stand ready to use force again'' should 
Saddam threaten his neighbors or attempt to reconstitute his weaponry. 
Also Saturday, a second U.S. aircraft carrier battle group _ led by 
the USS Carl Vinson _ moved into the Gulf to join the USS Enterprise 
group, U.S. Navy officials said. The inspectors, who had been working 
in Iraq since 1991, withdrew on Wednesday, a day after U.N. inspection 
chief Richard Butler told the U.N. Security Council that Iraq was 
not cooperating. That became the trigger for the U.S.-British attacks.
