Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Wednesday the latest Israeli 
condition for ratifying the new land-for-security deal had been partially 
met but suggested that total fulfillment was impossible. Arafat was 
responding to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's demand for written 
guarantees that all 30 men on a list of suspects wanted by Israel 
for killing Israelis would be detained by the Palestinian Authority. 
``We have detained 12 of them and we will continue working on this 
100 percent but...nobody can ask us to achieve 100 percent results,'' 
Arafat told a press conference in Madrid after talks with Prime Minister 
Jose Maria Aznar. The peace accord negotiated at Wye Plantation and 
signed in Washington on Oct. 23 commits Israel to withdraw from an 
additional 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for a Palestinian 
crackdown on Moslem extremists who oppose peace with Israel. But Israel 
reiterated Wednesday that it would not carry out the agreement until 
it received assurances from the Palestinian Authority headed by Arafat 
that it would arrest all 30 on the wanted list. Aides to Netanyahu 
said in Jerusalem that the Israeli cabinet would not be convened to 
ratify the accord until Israel got such a written guarantee from the 
United States. Arafat, who arrived in Madrid late Tuesday, said the 
12 detained were arrested prior to Netanyahu's latest insistence on 
the issue. Palestinian security officials have previously said that 
several of the men on the list had been arrested and tried, but never 
before given a specific number. Arafat also suggested that Israel 
had a responsibility to deal with extremist groups of its own. ``The 
extremists that exist on both sides are cooperating in order to wreck 
the peace process, '' he said. ``We should not forget that Rabin was 
assassinated by Israeli extremists.'' The head of the Palestinian 
Authority said that the Mideast peace process had inevitably slowed 
following the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin three 
years ago, and Netanyahu's coming to power in 1996. But Arafat claimed 
that 74 percent of the Israeli population favored the latest U.S.-backed 
peace initiative, and said he had conceded Netanyahu's earlier request 
for a 10-day postponement of its implementation after a call from 
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. With the latest conditions 
from Israel threatening to undermine the Wye Plantation accord, negotiated 
with the direct participation of President Bill Clinton, Arafat said 
he expected U.S. special envoy to the U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross 
to arrive in the region within the next few days. Earlier Wednesday 
Arafat met with King Juan Carlos and was due to hold talks with Foreign 
Minister Abel Matutes later in the day. The Palestinian leader was 
invited to Spain by Matutes, who was present when Arafat and Netanyahu 
signed the peace agreement Oct. 23. At their joint press conference 
Aznar said that the Spanish government considered that the Palestinians 
were fulfilling all their obligations in the Wye Plantation accord 
and that he ``hoped to soon be able to say the same about Israel.''
