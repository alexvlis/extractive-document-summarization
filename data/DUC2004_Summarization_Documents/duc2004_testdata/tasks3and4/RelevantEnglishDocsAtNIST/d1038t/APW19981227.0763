Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Sunday that Israel had ``frozen 
completely'' the peace process and was refusing to implement the latest 
land-for-security accord. The accusation came despite assurances from 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel would continue 
carrying out the agreement regardless of Israeli national elections 
expected in spring or early summer. Arafat was quoted by Egypt's Middle 
East News Agency as saying in Cairo earlier Sunday that Israel was 
using the elections as an excuse not to withdraw troops from the West 
Bank. But when asked upon his arrival in Gaza, he would only say that 
Israel ``must respect (the accord) as they respect all their commitments 
with all other countries.'' Asked if he believed Israel had frozen 
the implementation of the Wye accord, Arafat told reporters in Gaza: 
``No doubt. The Israeli side has completely frozen everything.'' On 
Dec. 2, Israel postponed the withdrawal of troops from parts of the 
West Bank as outlined in the Wye River agreement until the Palestinians 
fulfill several conditions. Israel withdrew in November from two percent 
of the West Bank under the Wye accord and was slated to pull out of 
11 percent more in two phases by the end of January. The Israeli demands 
include Palestinian agreement to stop saying they will declare a state 
on May 4, 1999, regardless of the state of the negotiations, to crack 
down on anti-Israeli incitement and rein in Islamic militants. Netanyahu 
said Friday that despite the Israeli election campaign, if the Palestinians 
fulfill the conditions, Israel will carry out its part of the agreement 
signed on Oct. 23 at the White House. The Palestinian Cabinet repeated 
its insistence on Friday that it will declare a state in May. An Arafat 
spokesman, Nabil Abourdeneh, called on the United States Sunday to 
pressure Israel to continue fulfilling its part of the Wye agreement 
despite the elections. ``We signed an agreement with the Israeli government 
and not with the Likud Party,'' Abourdeneh said in reference to Netanyahu's 
party. Meanwhile, Israel's airport authority accused the Palestinians 
of violating the Wye accord by refusing to allow its security officials 
to inspect an Egyptian plane that landed at the newly opened Gaza 
International Airport Sunday, Israel TV said. Israel retains security 
supervision over flights arriving at the Palestinian-run airport. 
In a sign of heightened tensions, Israeli soldiers shot rubber bullets 
and tear gas Sunday at Palestinians who threw rocks at them and Israeli 
vehicles near the Kalandia refugee camp north of Jerusalem. The clashes 
broke out after an Israeli police car hit and injured a Palestinian 
in the refugee camp, witnesses said.
