After nine days and nights of tortuous negotiations, Yasser Arafat, 
the Palestinian leader, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel 
Friday signed a modest agreement that restores life to the Middle 
East peace effort and opens the way for talks on a final resolution 
of the 50-year-old fight over whether the Palestinians will have a 
state. A proud, relieved President Clinton, who had seen the agreement 
threatened by a last-minute dispute with Netanyahu over the fate of 
the spy Jonathan Jay Pollard, presided over the signing ceremony in 
the White House. He was joined as host by a visibly ailing King Hussein 
of Jordan, who had been called in to push the talks toward a conclusion 
and spoke movingly of a search for peace that has consumed much of 
his life. The appearance of the king, wan and hairless from the effects 
of cancer therapy, beside the aged Arafat, still in his familiar headdress 
and uniform but with the trembling lip caused by ill health poignantly 
visible, seemed to underscore the long, debilitating path to even 
this relatively modest breakthrough in the talks between Israel and 
the Palestinians. The agreement in part serves to commit the two sides 
once again to actions they had already promised in 1993 and 1995 in 
agreements in Oslo, setting a detailed timetable for the Israelis 
to withdraw from 13 percent more of the West Bank in three phases 
over 12 weeks starting as soon as the agreement is ratified. That 
would bring to 40 percent the total territory that the Palestinians 
control fully or partially. In return the accord provides for specific 
steps by the Palestinians to fight terrorism and formally amend its 
charter to expunge clauses calling for Israel's destruction. Arafat 
and Netanyahu, who make no attempt to disguise their personal dislike, 
Friday shook hands under the gaze of the king of Jordan and spoke 
words of peace and determination. ``We will never leave the peace 
process, and we will never go back to violence and confrontation,'' 
Arafat said to applause in the White House East Room. Netanyahu declared: 
``Today is a day when Israel and our entire region are more secure. 
Now this has required sacrifice from both sides, and reaching into 
what Lincoln called the better nature of mankind.'' Clinton called 
the agreement an effort ``to rebuild trust and renew hope for peace.'' 
But he urged the leaders to ``carry out their commitments'' and to 
have the courage to withstand the inevitable attacks from ``the enemies 
of peace'' from both sides. This final tableau of hope and self-congratulation 
was delayed and slightly soured, officials said, by an extraordinary 
last-minute demand by Netanyahu _ at 7 a.m. after the final substance 
of the accord had been settled during a sleepless night _ that the 
United States release Pollard, an American convicted of spying for 
Israel. Clinton rejected the demand to release Pollard, imprisoned 
since 1985, immediately. But he promised at the White House ceremony 
``to review this matter seriously,'' a significant concession in itself 
since this president and two predecessors have reviewed and rejected 
numerous appeals for pardon, clemency and parole for Pollard. In return 
for this public promise, which may help Netanyahu with his right wing 
at home, officials said, the Israeli prime minister agreed to sign 
Friday's agreement and not renege on his promise to release 750 Palestinian 
prisoners. This agreement is designed to carry out long-delayed Israeli 
withdrawals from the West Bank called for under the 1993 and 1995 
Oslo accords. Netanyahu campaigned for office as an opponent of those 
accords, by which Israel and the Palestinians recognize each other's 
right to live in peace and commit themselves to negotiations on a 
final settlement between them. These withdrawals were supposed to 
take place as interim steps, to build up confidence, but instead they 
created a mounting crisis of mistrust and anger, as Netanyahu insisted 
that the Palestinians keep specific commitments to fight terrorism 
and restrain the number of weapons in areas they control in return 
for land. Despite enormous American efforts, it has taken 19 months 
_ and then these 9 long days and nearly 90 hours of Clinton's own 
time _ to seal even this interim deal. The agreement is ``a big step 
that came too late,'' Clinton acknowledged. ``It is true that whatever 
we achieved is only temporary and that it has been late, but our agreement 
underscores that the peace process is going ahead.'' But compared 
with the risks and costs of failure, these talks were an enormous 
success. However difficult the sessions at the Wye River Conference 
Centers on Maryland's Eastern Shore, and however modest the specifics 
of this deal, an inability to reach agreement here would have had 
serious consequences for the Middle East and American stature in the 
region, especially among Washington's moderate Arab allies. With another 
crisis brewing with Iraq and with the deadline for the entire Oslo 
process running out next May, senior U.S. officials say, they understood 
that American strategic interests required progress here and a quick 
start on trying to resolve the most difficult questions of Palestine's 
borders, whether it will be a state or not and the future of Jerusalem. 
As part of this accord, intensive negotiations are to begin immediately 
on a final peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians, but 
given the delay and the onset of the Jewish Sabbath, when the Israeli 
government does not work, those talks could not get started Friday, 
as American officials had hoped. Instead, they will open after this 
agreement is ratified, and Clinton may invite these leaders back for 
another summit meeting. Netanyahu, in particular, was unstinting in 
his praise for Clinton, calling him a tireless and boundlessly optimistic 
man with ``a precious and unique gift,'' the ability ``to nudge and 
prod and suggest and use a nimble and flexible mind to truly explore 
the possibilities of both sides, and never just on one side.'' Those 
words, an American official said, helped ameliorate the ``sour mood'' 
created when Netanyahu ``created a needless crisis this morning in 
a clumsy attempt to get something he could not have,'' the release 
of Pollard. In turn, Clinton praised Netanyahu for his strength, will 
and grasp of detail. ``He showed himself willing to take political 
risks for peace, but not to risk the security of his people,'' the 
president said. ``As a result, this agreement embodies an enormous 
increase in the security of the people of Israel.'' Clinton's words 
also reflect an American judgment, officials said, that Netanyahu 
is politically strong in Israel, despite his willingness to anger 
his own right wing, and is likely to win re-election. Netanyahu even 
thanked Arafat for his cooperation and his wishes for a happy 49th 
birthday on the very day, Wednesday, that the Israeli threatened to 
leave the talks before backing down. Arafat spoke of Netanyahu as 
a ``co-partner'' in peace like his favorite Israeli, Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995. To applause, Arafat acknowledged 
the difficulties of getting this accord but vowed, ``We will never 
leave the peace process. and we will never go back to violence and 
confrontation.'' And Hussein, who intervened at key moments in the 
talks, as the Americans asked him to, with emotional appeals for peace 
and stern admonishments for narrow politics, said Israel and the Palestinians 
were moving in the right direction. The king appealed to the better 
instincts of everyone in the East Room. ``There has been enough destruction, 
enough death, enough waste,'' the king said. ``And it's time that 
together we occupy a place beyond ourselves, our peoples, that is 
worthy of them and of their sons, the descendants of the children 
of Abraham.'' The leaders then signed the accords on a walnut conference 
table bought by President Grant in 1869 and last used in 1994 for 
the peace treaty between Jordan and Israel, signed by Rabin and Hussein. 
This accord marks an important and little understood deepening and 
institutionalizing of the U.S. role in the Middle East. Not only did 
Clinton promise yet more financial aid _ to Israel for security measures 
and to the Palestinians for development. But the CIA will play an 
uncomfortably visible role as the validator of Palestinian performance 
on fighting terrorism, as it sits on a committee with the heads of 
the Israeli and Palestinian security services. Clinton himself will 
go, for the first time, officials believe, to the Gaza Strip to preside 
over the Palestinian meeting that amends the Palestinian charter. 
That could begin a new and more formal relationship between the United 
States and the Palestinian Authority. Friday's agreement, with small 
variations from a longstanding American proposal widely published 
in the past, gives benefits to both sides. The Israelis won the formal, 
public change in the Palestinian charter that Netanyahu and his influential 
industry minister, Natan Sharansky, have insisted upon: to remove 
the 26 clauses calling for Israel's destruction. While Arafat says 
the clauses are long gone, the Israelis demanded a formal vote by 
the large Palestine National Council, which contains expatriates and 
terrorists living abroad. While there is some fudging over how the 
Palestine National Council will be defined in the accord _ it will 
be subsumed in a larger gathering of other Palestinian organizations 
more easily controlled by Arafat, and which Clinton has agreed to 
attend _ Israel will get the public ``turning of the page'' that Sharansky 
wanted. The Israelis have also won a Palestinian pledge to jail 30 
of the 31 Palestinians wanted in Israel for killing Israelis, while 
the Central Intelligence Agency will monitor their incarceration and 
their cases. Israel did not get Arafat to agree to jail the chief 
of the Palestinian police in Gaza, Ghazi Jabali. The Palestinians, 
for their part, got an agreement from the Israelis to release 750 
prisoners in three stages and a guarantee that they will get a third 
Israeli redeployment from the West Bank, as called for under the Oslo 
accords. But Israel gets to determine the redeployment's size, which 
Netanyahu has told his Cabinet will be between 1 percent and 2 percent 
of the West Bank. Still, that will bring areas under Palestinian partial 
or full control to more than 40 percent of the West Bank _ the basis 
for the Palestinian state that Arafat dreams of and that even the 
hawkish Israeli foreign minister, Ariel Sharon, admits is now inevitable. 
Asked Friday whether this agreement brings a Palestinian state closer 
into being, an Arafat aide, Marwan Kanafani, smiled broadly and said 
simply, ``Yes.''
