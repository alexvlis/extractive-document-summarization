Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu complained in a letter to U.S. President 
Bill Clinton that the Palestinians have repeatedly violated the Wye 
River peace agreement, officials said Wednesday. At the same time, 
Palestinian officials accused Israel of violating the Wye River summit 
accord by not freeing jailed Palestinian activists and by confiscating 
West Bank land. There are concerns that the escalating tension could 
result in a new round of violence in advance of Clinton's planned 
trip to Israel and the Palestinian lands later this month. In Jerusalem, 
a 41-year-old Palestinian street cleaner, Osama Musa Natche, was stabbed 
to death in a mixed neighborhood on the border between the Arab and 
Jewish sectors of the city. Israeli police said they were investigating 
the possibility that the killer was an Israeli who has already murdered 
one Palestinian and wounded five in earlier attacks. ``There are a 
number of items of evidence on the scene of the crime which suggests 
that the motive for the crime was nationalist,'' said Jerusalem police 
commander Yair Yitzhaki. In a two-page letter sent Sunday, Netanyahu 
asked Clinton to step in and use his influence to halt the Palestinian 
violations. David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Netanyahu, said the sending 
of the letter indicates that ``there is a danger to the peace process 
if the violations continue.'' But he said that, as of now, the Clinton 
visit to the region Dec. 12-15 was ``a go.'' In the letter, Bar-Illan 
said, Netanyahu objected to recent statements, including one by Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat, that a Palestinian state would be declared on 
May 4, 1999. The daily Maariv newspaper said Netanyahu asked Clinton 
to publicly distance himself from Arafat's statements and persuade 
the Palestinian leader to withdraw his remarks. The Wye accord, negotiated 
with Clinton's help in October, urges both Israel and the Palestinians 
to refrain from unilateral steps that would prejudge the outcome of 
talks on a permanent peace accord that are scheduled to be complete 
by next May 4. The Palestinians issued a series of complaints about 
Israeli violations of the Wye accord reached in October. It obligates 
Israel to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank in three stages 
by the end of January in exchange for Palestinian security measures, 
including a crackdown on Islamic militants. Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud 
Abbas, said Wednesday that Israel's plans to construct more than a 
dozen access roads for Jewish settlements in the West Bank was not 
approved at the Wye River summit. Israel's Cabinet approved the building 
to improve security for Jewish communities isolated by the planned 
withdrawals. Thousands of acres of Palestinian land are being expropriated 
for the road projects. ``I want to make it very clear that there is 
no such agreement because no rational Palestinian would agree to the 
confiscation of land for roads,'' Abbas said on the Voice of Palestine 
radio. Palestinians protested Israel's appointment of a low-level 
delegation to deal with the issue of a further withdrawal after the 
13 percent pullback. They said this was an indication that Israel 
was not taking Palestinian concerns seriously. The Palestinians also 
complained that Israel broke a promise concerning prisoner releases. 
Under the Wye accord, Israel is to free 750 prisoners in three stages. 
In the first stage last month, Israel freed 250 prisoners, but 150 
of them were common criminals. Arafat wants all of those released 
to be Palestinians jailed for anti-Israeli activities. Bar-Illan said 
the criteria for the releases were agreed on at the Mideast summit 
and that Israel was in compliance. Netanyahu has said he would not 
release prisoners involved in attacks on Israelis or members of Islamic 
militant groups. Despite the renewed acrimony, Clinton's visit to 
Israel and the Palestinian areas appeared to be proceeding on schedule. 
The highlight is Clinton's attendance on Dec. 14 of a special session 
of the Palestine National Council, the Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, 
in Gaza City. Local Palestinian legislators and members of Palestinian 
factions will also be present. In the session, Israel wants the Palestinians 
to reaffirm in a vote the revocation of clauses in the Palestine Liberation 
Organization's founding charter calling for Israel's destruction. 
Palestinians officials insist there will be no formal meeting of the 
PNC and that there is no need for a vote since the clauses were already 
deleted two years ago. Netanyahu has said he will accept nothing short 
of a vote. It was not clear Wednesday whether formal invitations to 
the PNC members living abroad have already been issued. However, the 
Palestinian Authority has asked Israel to grant entry permits for 
25 PNC members who in the past were barred from the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip. Among those on the list is Farouk Kaddoumi, a top PLO 
official opposed to peace with Israel, and Nayef Hawatmeh, leader 
of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a radical 
PLO faction. After the Gaza meeting, five percent of the West Bank 
is to be transferred from sole Israeli control to joint jurisdiction.
