MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Saturday 
it has become ``imperative'' for American allies in the Gulf to acquire 
a ballistic missile defense system to counter long range weapons in 
the hands of countries such as Iran and Iraq. Cohen said the United 
States has five defense systems under research and development and 
``we hope we hope we can share that technology with Bahrain and other 
Gulf countries.'' He was speaking to reporters before leaving for 
Qatar, his second stop in a six-nation Gulf tour, which includes the 
United Arab Emirates, Oman, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. ``Because of 
the proliferation of missile technology globally but especially in 
the Gulf region, we believe it's important'' to look at ways to cooperate 
with U.S. allies, said Cohen. ``I think it becomes imperative that 
countries cooperate and develop a theater missile protection system 
for their people and for their forces,'' said Cohen, citing threats 
from Iran and Iraq. The United States sees Iraq and Iran, which recently 
tested a long-range missile, as major threats to the Gulf region. 
Cohen said Iraq, which is under U.N. sanctions, continues efforts 
to acquire missile technology that has a longer range than it is permitted 
to have During his three-day stay in Bahrain, which is home to U.S. 
Navy's 5th Fleet, Cohen met high-ranking officials including the emir 
Sheik Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa, the Crown Prince Sheik Hamad bin 
Isa Al Khalifa and the Defense Minister Sheik Khalifa bin Ahmed Al 
Khalifa. Cohen said his meetings with Bahraini officials were ``very 
successful.'' Among various issues, the two countries discussed the 
threats posed by weapons of mass destruction programs in both Iraq, 
Iran and terrorism. Cohen said both the United States and Bahrain 
held similar opinions on the issues.
