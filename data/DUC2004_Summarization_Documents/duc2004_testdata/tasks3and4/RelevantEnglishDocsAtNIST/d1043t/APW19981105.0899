CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen ended a six-nation 
tour of the Gulf on Thursday, saying the United States has ``the support 
it needs.'' But he appeared to gain little public backing for possible 
military strikes against Iraq. In the United Arab Emirates, his last 
stop, President Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan called for a political 
solution to the crisis with Iraq, the official Emirates News Agency 
reported. Earlier, in Oman, Sultan Qaboos reportedly told Cohen that 
he opposed any unilateral U.S. strike against Iraq, which ended its 
cooperation with U.N. inspectors on Saturday. ``The issue must be 
handled through the United Nations,'' Qaboos was quoted as saying 
by Omani officials. Cohen also visited Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain 
and Qatar. He later flew to Egypt, where he met President Hosni Mubarak 
and Egypt's defense and foreign ministers in the Red Sea resort of 
Sharm el-Sheik, the Middle East News Agency reported. Kenneth Bacon, 
spokesman for Cohen, said the secretary had completed ``successful 
consultations'' with Gulf leaders. ``Based on his meetings, Secretary 
Cohen is confident that the United States will have the support it 
needs to take appropriate action to uphold the United Nations Security 
Council resolutions,'' Bacon said in a statement released by the Pentagon. 
It did not detail what the responses might be. Cohen was expected 
to visit Jordan and Turkey. At least publicly, there has been little 
support across the region for any U.S. military action against Iraq, 
which has gained sympathy for its worsening plight under sweeping 
U.N. sanctions. ``We see no reason to provoke a crisis with Iraq other 
than to distract attention from the president's personal problems,'' 
the Dubai-based Al-Bayan newspaper said in an editorial. Reflecting 
the feeling in the Arab world that Washington is tough on Iraq and 
soft on Israel, Egypt's Al-Akhbar said that ``the giant United States 
has become a lion before Iraq but an ostrich and a helpless rat before 
Israel.'' The United States and Britain have not ruled out military 
strikes on Iraq to try to force Baghdad to rescind its decision to 
end cooperation with U.N. inspectors. The U.N. Security Council has 
condemned the Iraqi decision. The United States has some 24,000 troops, 
an aircraft carrier and some 170 warplanes and helicopters in the 
Gulf region, according to the Pentagon. It is not clear, however, 
whether the United States' Gulf allies would allow the use of bases 
on their territory. On Tuesday, a Saudi official said King Fahd told 
the defense secretary that the kingdom would not be ``a springboard 
for attacks on Iraq.'' The official spoke on condition of anonymity. 
But the Pentagon said Cohen was assured of Saudi backing in the event 
of military action against Iraq. During the standoff between Iraq 
and the U.N. over weapons inspectors in February, Kuwait was the only 
Arab state that opened its air bases to U.S. and British warplanes.
