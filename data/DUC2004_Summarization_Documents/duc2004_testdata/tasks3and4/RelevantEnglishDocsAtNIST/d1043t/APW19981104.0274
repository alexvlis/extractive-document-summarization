MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen arrived 
here Wednesday on a brief visit for talks with the Bahraini government, 
the official Gulf News Agency said. The agency did not give the substance 
of the talks, but Cohen is touring the Middle East to drum up for 
possible U.S. military action against Iraq. Iraq's decision Saturday 
to end all cooperation with disarmament monitors has been condemned 
by the U.N. Security Council as a ``flagrant violation'' of the country's 
agreements with the world body. Earlier Wednesday Cohen flew to Kuwait 
where he discussed the Iraqi situation with the emir, Sheik Jaber 
al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and the crown prince and prime minister, Sheik 
Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said in Kuwait. 
Cohen did not speak to reporters during his Kuwaiti visit. The defense 
secretary began his tour Tuesday with a visit to Saudi Arabia. There 
have been different accounts of the talks in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. 
The Pentagon has said Cohen was assured of Saudi backing in the event 
of military action against Iraq, but a Saudi official _ speaking on 
condition of anonymity _ said King Fahd told the defense secretary 
that the kingdom would not be ``a springboard for attacks on Iraq.'' 
During the last standoff between Iraq and the world body over weapons 
inspectors in February, Kuwait was alone among Arab states in opening 
its air bases to American and British warplanes. But on Tuesday night, 
a spokesman for Kuwait's defense ministry said the emirate was ``not 
a party to the dispute between the United Nations and Iraq and it 
always strives for peace,'' the state-run Kuwait News Agency reported. 
During the earlier crisis, almost all Arab governments publicly opposed 
an attack on Iraq, while U.S. officials maintained they were privately 
assured of support. Arab newspapers reported that Cohen was actually 
told that Arab leaders would support an attack on Iraq only if it 
was guaranteed to remove President Saddam Hussein. Several thousand 
U.S. troops and their weapons are positioned here under a 10-year 
defense pact that Kuwait signed with Washington after the 1991 Gulf 
War that liberated it from a seven-month Iraqi occupation.
