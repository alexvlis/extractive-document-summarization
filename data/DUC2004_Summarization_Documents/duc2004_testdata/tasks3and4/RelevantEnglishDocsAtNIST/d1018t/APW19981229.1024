Four Westerners held hostage by militant Islamic tribesmen were killed 
on Tuesday as Yemeni security forces stormed their hideout. A statement 
issued by Yemen's Interior Ministry said that the kidnappers killed 
three of the captives and that a fourth, who was wounded in the incident, 
died later in a hospital. In London, British Foreign Secretary Robin 
Cook said the dead included three British hostages and an Australian. 
Earlier there had been confusion over the number of fatalities and 
their nationalities, and a high-ranking security official had said 
an American woman was among those killed. The U.S. State Department 
later said an American was wounded. The Interior Ministry statement 
said that members of the ``extremist terrorist gang'' kidnapped the 
16 Westerners and killed three of the captives _ two men and a woman. 
``They proceeded in killing the captives after refusing any attempts 
at negotiations, which led security forces to storm the area to prevent 
further bloodshed and ensure the safe release of the rest of the hostages,'' 
the statement continued. One of the wounded hostages, a Briton, died 
later in hospital, the statement said. It said that three of the kidnappers 
were killed and that one of them was an Egyptian national. Earlier 
reports said a policeman was killed and three wounded in the shootout. 
Helicopters were dispatched to the area to evacuate the injured, said 
the security official, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. 
The kidnapping happened Monday near the southern town of Mawdiyah, 
about 200 kilometers (175 miles) south of the Yemen capital San`a. 
The hostages included 12 Britons _ six of them women _ two American 
women and two Australian men. They were taken when 18 men ambushed 
a convoy of five vehicles in which the tourists were traveling and 
opened fire on their police escorts. The kidnappers threatened to 
kill the tourists if the police did not back off. During the melee, 
the British tour leader and a Yemeni guide escaped and raised the 
alarm. Kidnapping of tourists by tribes is a commonly used method 
in Yemen to gain concessions from the government such as new roads, 
water supply or clinics. The hostages generally are released unharmed. 
But the latest incident marked the first time an abduction was carried 
out by Islamic militants. Security officials said the kidnappers belong 
to Islamic Jihad, many of whose leaders fought in Afghanistan and 
are believed to have connections with Egyptian Muslim radicals. Earlier 
Tuesday, Yemeni officials began negotiations with the Islamic militants 
for the release of the tourists. Some 200 Yemeni security forces encircled 
the area. Gov. Ahmad Ali Mohsen of Abyan province, where the kidnapping 
took place, was leading the talks with leaders of the Al-Fadl tribe, 
to which the kidnappers belong, an official at the governor's office 
said. Mohsen was accompanied by Islamic figures who are influential 
with the abductors, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
The kidnappers demanded the release of their leader, Saleh Haidara 
al-Atwi, who was arrested two weeks ago as part of a government crackdown 
on Islamic vigilantes enforcing strict Islamic rules in southern Yemen. 
The kidnappers also wanted the release of another leader, Yemen security 
officials said. They did not identify him. They said Islamic Jihad 
members flogged women for ignoring the Islamic dress code and men 
for selling and drinking alcohol, which is forbidden in Islam. The 
group, which has no more than 200 members, also ran a military camp 
in southern Yemen, the security officials said. Yemen was once a haven 
for Islamic militant fugitives from other countries, but the government 
has expelled many of them. A British couple and their teen-age son 
were kidnapped in April but released unharmed a month later. Four 
Germans currently are being held by a tribe in northeast Yemen. The 
kidnappers are demanding more schools, hospitals and telephone lines 
in their area.
