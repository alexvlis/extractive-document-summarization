Yemeni officials on Tuesday started negotiations with Islamic extremists 
for the release of 16 Western tourists while security forces encircled 
the area where the militants are said to be holding the hostages. 
Gov. Ahmad Ali Mohsen of Abyan province, where the kidnapping took 
place, is talking with leaders of the Al-Fadl tribe, to which the 
kidnappers belong, an official at the governor's office said. Mohsen 
is accompanied by Islamic personalities influential with the abductors, 
the official said on condition of anonymity. A security official said 
about 200 troops were deployed in Abyan Tuesday. The kidnapping occurred 
Monday near the southern town of Mawdiyah, about 200 kilometers (175 
miles) south of the capital, San`a. The hostages include 12 Britons, 
six of them women, two American women and two Australian men. Britain's 
ambassador to Yemen, Victor Henderson, told Britain's Sky News that 
the hostages are safe and well and no one has been harmed. Kidnapping 
of tourists by tribes is a commonly used method in Yemen to gain concessions 
from the government such as new roads, water supply or clinics. The 
hostages are usually released unharmed. But this is the first time 
an abduction has been carried out by Islamic extremists. Security 
officials said the kidnappers belong to Islamic Jihad, many of whose 
leaders fought in Afghanistan and are believed to have connections 
with Egyptian Muslim radicals. The group is demanding the release 
of its leader, Saleh Haidara al-Atwi, who was arrested two weeks ago 
as part of a government crackdown on Islamic vigilantes enforcing 
strict Islamic rules in southern Yemen. The kidnappers also are demanding 
the release of another leader, security officials said. They did not 
identify him. They said Islamic Jihad members flogged women for ignoring 
the Islamic dress code and men for selling and drinking alcohol, which 
is forbidden in Islam. The group, which has no more than 200 members, 
also ran a military camp in southern Yemen, said the officials, speaking 
on condition of anonymity. They said the kidnappers, who included 
10 gunmen and eight others, ambushed a convoy of five vehicles in 
which the tourists were traveling and opened fire on a number of policemen 
escorting them. The gunmen threatened to kill the hostages if the 
police didn't back off, said one official. He said all the gunmen 
sported beards typical of Islamists and had received military training. 
During the melee, the British tour leader and a Yemeni guide escaped 
and raised alarm. The Australian Embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, 
which handles Yemen, said a diplomat was on his way to San`a Tuesday 
to try to secure the release of the hostages. A British couple and 
their teenage son were kidnapped in April but released unharmed a 
month later. Four Germans are also being held at present by a tribe 
in northeast Yemen. The kidnappers are demanding more schools, hospitals 
and telephone lines in their area. Yemen was once a haven for Islamic 
militant fugitives from other countries, but the government has expelled 
many of them.
