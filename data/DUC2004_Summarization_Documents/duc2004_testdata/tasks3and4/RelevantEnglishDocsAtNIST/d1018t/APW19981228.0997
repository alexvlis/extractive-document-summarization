Islamic militants kidnapped 16 Western tourists in southern Yemen 
Monday, including 12 Britons, two Americans and two Australians, security 
officials said. They said the kidnappers, who belong to the Islamic 
Jihad extremist group, were demanding the release of their leader 
Saleh Haidara al-Atwi, who was arrested by Yemeni authorities two 
weeks ago. Tribal leaders said about 10 gunmen ambushed a convoy of 
five vehicles carrying a group of 17 tourists near the southern town 
of Mawdiyah, in the Abyan province. They opened fire on a number of 
policemen escorting the tourists. No one was injured in the firefight, 
but the group's British tour leader and a Yemeni guide managed to 
escape, said the tribal leaders, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
The remaining 16 tourists were abducted and driven to an unknown destination 
in Abyan province, about 200 kilometers (175 miles) south of the capital, 
San`a. The British tourists included six women and six men. The remaining 
tourists were two American women and two Australian men. Security 
officials in Abyan, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said 
al-Atwi's arrest was part of a crackdown on Islamic vigilantes who 
were enforcing strict Islamic rules on the population of southern 
Yemen. They said members of the group flogged men for selling and 
drinking alcohol _ which is forbidden in Islam _ and women for ignoring 
the Islamic dress code. The group, which has no more than 200 members, 
also ran a military camp in southern Yemen, said the officials. The 
kidnappers are also demanding the release of another leader. The security 
sources did not identify him. Britain's Press Association said the 
tourists were traveling with the British tour company Explore in conjunction 
with a local operator in San`a. ``The British tourists are all young 
but I cannot say any more,'' PA quoted the operator, Yahya al-Haifi, 
as saying. In London, a Foreign Office spokesman said Britain was 
in touch with Yemeni authorities. ``We have made it clear that our 
top priority is the safe and swift return of the hostages,'' the spokesman 
said on condition of anonymity. The Foreign Office advised that British 
nationals traveling to Yemen should ``keep in touch with developments'' 
during their stay. Monday's abduction brings to 20 the total number 
of Westerners held hostage in Yemen. Members of the Bani Dhabyan tribe 
are holding four Germans _ three women and one man _ in the province 
of Marib, 170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast of San`a. The tribesmen 
are pressing the government to provide more schools, hospitals, telephone 
lines and roads. The Germans were seized on Dec. 7.
