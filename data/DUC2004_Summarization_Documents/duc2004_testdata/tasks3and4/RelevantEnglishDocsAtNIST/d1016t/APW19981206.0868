ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - U.N. Secretary General Kofi 
Annan arrived here Sunday to attend a summit of the Gulf Cooperation 
Council, a federation of six Arab Gulf states. Annan, who flew in 
from the Tunisian island of Jerba met Saturday with Libyan leader 
Moammar Gadhafi in the Libyan desert to try to arrange the trial of 
two suspects in the bombing of a Pan Am airliner. But they failed 
to reach an agreement. The 60-year-old Annan is trying to get Libya 
to go along with a U.S.-British plan to try the two suspects before 
a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands for the 1988 bombing 
over Lockerbie, Scotland. Annan and South Africa's President Nelson 
Mandela are in Abu Dhabi to attend the GCC summit. The GCC groups 
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.
