Six Gulf Arab leaders meet in Abu Dhabi on Monday for a summit expected 
to focus on their countries' falling oil revenues and a request to 
finance a U.S. missile ``shield'' for the region. The leaders _ who 
collectively control nearly 45 percent of the world's oil reserves 
and 15 percent of its natural gas reserves _ were also expected to 
discuss relations with their big neighbors, Iran and Iraq. For the 
first time, the annual summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council will 
be attended by leaders from outside the grouping. U.N. Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan, South African President Nelson Mandela, Arab League Secretary-General 
Esmat Abdel-Meguid, and the secretary general of the Organization 
of the Islamic Conference, Azeddine Laraki, were to attend the three-day 
meeting. Annan and Mandela were apparently invited to add luster to 
the meeting of the GCC, a loose economic and political alliance of 
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates 
that was founded in 1981. Annan was to brief the statesmen on Security 
Council sanctions on Iraq and ask them to boost their national contributions 
to U.N. agencies, U.N. sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
Some GCC members, such as the Emirates, favor lifting the sanctions 
to end the suffering of Iraq's people. But Kuwait, whose invasion 
by Iraq triggered the sanctions in 1990, and Saudi Arabia, which Iraq 
attacked during the subsequent Gulf War, insist that the sanctions 
remain until Baghdad has complied with U.N. Security Council resolutions. 
These call for Iraq to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction. 
Perhaps the most vexing issue for the GCC states will be how to rebound 
from the collapse of oil prices. On Dec. 1, the benchmark Brent futures 
hit dlrs 10.42 per barrel _ a 12-year-low. The Gulf oil producers 
have been hit hard by the sharp drop in prices. For example, Saudi 
Arabia had projected a dlrs 4.8 billion budget deficit for 1998, but 
analysts predict the deficit will reach dlrs 15 billion. According 
to Emirates officials and Western diplomats, who insisted on anonymity, 
the summit was also to discuss American and British efforts to overthrow 
Saddam Hussein and the U.S. plan to set up a ``shield'' of missile 
batteries in the region. One diplomat said that the GCC reaction to 
the plan was not as negative as first believed when U.S. Secretary 
of Defense William Cohen promoted the shield plan and asked for funds 
during his October tour of Gulf states. The diplomat also said the 
summit might appoint an envoy to Iran, with the job of crafting a 
common policy toward Iran meant to thwart Tehran's attempts to move 
closer to individual GCC members. Iran enjoys good relations with 
Qatar, Kuwait and Oman. But the GCC remains wary of Iran's growing 
military power and its revolutionary brand of Islam. The council has 
repeatedly urged Tehran to withdraw from three tiny islands in the 
Gulf. The Emirates claim ownership of Abu Musa and the Greater and 
Lesser Tunb islands, which Iran annexed in 1992.
