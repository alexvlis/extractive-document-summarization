The leaders of six Gulf Arab states on Wednesday extended current 
cuts in oil production until the end of next year, ending their summit 
on the problems caused by record-low oil prices. Members of the Organization 
of Petroleum Exporting Countries and producers outside the cartel 
agreed in June to withdraw 3.1 million barrels a day from the market 
for one year. OPEC's share of that was 2.6 million barrels per day. 
The Gulf Cooperation Council states ``agreed to extend their pledged 
cuts until the end of 1999. At the same time, they urged other producers 
to take similar steps to achieve market stability for the benefit 
of producers and consumers,'' said a communique released at the close 
of the three-day summit. The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, 
Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. They together control 
half the world's proven reserves of oil. All but Oman and Bahrain 
are OPEC members. The summit has been overshadowed by record-low oil 
prices that have hit hard the economies of the Gulf Arab countries 
hard. The GCC states depend on oil exports for 75 percent of their 
revenue. While the political leaders and oil ministers decided to 
extend the existing production cuts to December 1999, they decided 
not to reduce output further. They were not convinced that deeper 
cuts would shore up the market, a Gulf official said, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. However, their decision could be reviewed 
at the next OPEC meeting in March if oil prices continue their downward 
slide, the official said. Jamil al-Hojeilan, the secretary-general 
of the GCC, said Tuesday that overproduction by oil-rich nations was 
to blame for the price slump. Al-Hojeilan told the Middle East Broadcasting 
Corp., an Arabic TV network, that ``the whole problem'' was caused 
by countries not sticking to their production quotas. Analysts say 
Venezuela, Iran, Indonesia and Qatar are the main over-producers. 
``The strategic view of oil policy in the GCC countries is to keep 
a balance between supply and demand. We hope that pledges of abiding 
by quotas agreed upon are respected,'' al-Hojeilan said. He denied 
that GCC oil ministers had agreed to reduce production. Officials 
at the summit had earlier made such a claim to The Associated Press, 
adding that the GCC ministers also agreed to ask other producers inside 
and outside OPEC to join them in the cuts, starting in March. Shortly 
before the GCC meeting began, January futures contracts for Brent 
crude _ a widely watched benchmark _ fell to a record low of dlrs 
9.92 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange in London. Gulf 
oil generally sells at a dollar or two less than the North Sea's Brent 
_ which itself was selling for around dlrs 20 a barrel as recently 
as 1997. At the start of the three-day summit Monday, Saudi Arabia's 
Crown Prince Abdullah warned that the oil boom days were over and 
that Gulf states should face the new reality and tighten their belts. 
He suggested setting a maximum deadline of one year for setting up 
a GCC customs union that has been under discussion for 15 years. The 
summit's final communique said an agreement on the customs union has 
to be drawn up by 1999 and implemented in the year 2001. The union, 
the first step to a common market, is a prerequisite for free trade 
deals with other trading blocs such as the GCC's main trading partner, 
the European Union. The final communique called on Iraq to abide by 
all U.N. Security Council resolutions and to admit that its 1990 invasion 
of Kuwait was a mistake. The resolution also urged Iran to work for 
a peaceful settlement of a territorial dispute with the Emirates, 
said the officials. Both states claim Abu Musa and the Greater and 
Lesser Tunbs, three tiny islands that Iran annexed in 1992.
