Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia will resign in early December, a leader 
of the leftist Workers Party said Monday. Louisa Hanoune, speaking 
at a news conference, said President Liamine Zeroual had told her 
in a meeting Sunday that Ouyahia and several other government ministers 
would be stepping down ``around Dec. 10.'' Previously, the government 
had said Ouyahia's government would ``very probably'' resign after 
presenting Parliament with the annual report of its work sometime 
in December. Zeroual said that in addition to Ouyahia, Communications 
Minister Hamraoui Habib Chawki, interim Justice Minister Hamed Nouj 
and Interior Minister Mustapha Ben Mansour would be resigning, according 
to Hanoune. Zeroual did not reveal who would replace the ministers, 
Hanoune said, but noted only that the successors would be ``non-partisan.'' 
Zeroual met with Hanoune to discuss presidential elections, which 
are now set for April. In September, the Algerian President announced 
that he would cut short his five-year term which normally ends in 
the year 2000. Ouyahia, prime minister since January 1996, has not 
denied rumors over his own reported plans to run for the presidency. 
Names of numerous potential candidates have circulated unofficially. 
In the past, it has been the army that determines the nation's president, 
drawn from military ranks. Zeroual is a retired general.
