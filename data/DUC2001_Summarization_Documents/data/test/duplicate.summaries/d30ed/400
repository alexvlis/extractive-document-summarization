Poverty is a near universal condition in much of the world. One
billion people live on less than one dollar a day.

More than 110 million Third World children lack access even to primary
education.  Extreme poverty is further complicated by horrific
inequality.  In Mexico, life expectancy for the poorest 10 percent is
20 years less than for the richest 10 percent.

In 1992, World Bank president Lewis Preston issued a directive to link
loan volume to the strength of a country's efforts to fight poverty.

The link between loans and poverty relief forms part of a new drive to
make poverty alleviation the bank's central mission in the 1990's.

At the opening session of the 42nd General Assembly in 1988, Third
World countries led by Brazil blamed industrialized nations in part
for perpetuating their poverty.

A similar theme sounded in West Berlin, where finance ministers of 22
developed or developing countries demanded "more forceful action" to
help Third World countries repay $1.2 trillion in debts.

In 1990, Third World debtors had to pay $50.1 billion more to service
their debts to the United States and other creditors than they
received in new loans "a major drain on their already cash-strapped
economies" the World Bank Reported.

The net cash drain from the debtor countries to the richer ones began
in 1984.  Until then, the richer countries had provided more in new
loans to Third World nation than those countries paid back.

Lord Bauer, House of Lords, Westminster SWI expressed concern that the
international community may be encouraging Third World countries to
default on loans by canceling or rescheduling debts "frequently
several times for the same country."

Others feel that there are different ways to alleviate poverty and
large debt.

In September 1991, John Hatch, founder of the non-profit Foundation
for International Community Assistance developed a concept of using
small revolving loans to poor women to finance their private
enterprise.  The loans will allow them to create savings while paying
interest of 1 percent to 3 percent and qualifying for bigger loans.

Using the Hatch concept, U.S. development organizations are finding
that some of the world's poorest entrepreneurs repay their debts at
rates approaching 100%.

Tiny Third World businesses commonly repay "microloans" faithfully
because they crave the security of a favorable credit rating.  The
money helps them start or expand their businesses and boosts their
local economies.</SUM>
