Poverty is a near universal condition in much of the world. One
billion people live on less than one dollar a day.

More than 110 million Third World children lack access even to primary
education. In Mexico, life expectancy for the poorest 10 percent is 20
years less than for the richest 10 percent.

In 1992, World Bank president Lewis Preston issued a directive to link
loan volume to the strength of a country's efforts to fight poverty.

The link between loans and poverty relief forms part of a new drive to
make poverty alleviation the bank's central mission in the 1990's.


In 1990, Third World debtors had to pay $50.1 billion more to service
their debts to the United and other creditors than they received in
new loans.

Until 1984, the richer countries had provided more in new loans to
Third World nation than those countries paid back.

In September 1991, John Hatch, founder of the non-profit Foundation
for International Community Assistance developed a concept of using
small revolving loans to poor women to finance their private
enterprise.
                                                                         
Using the Hatch concept, U.S. development organizations are finding
that some of the world's poorest entrepreneurs repay their debts at
rates approaching 100%.</SUM>
