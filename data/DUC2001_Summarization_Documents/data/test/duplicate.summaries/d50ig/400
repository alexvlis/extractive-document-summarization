In June 1988, the Reagan administration moved to deal with a drought
plaguing much of the nation.  An interagency group was appointed,
although there was no prediction as to what kind of relief might be
authorized.  The Administration was concerned about curbing its export
enhancement plan.  Bankers worried about borrowers' financial help.
Farm equipment makers were concerned about sales.  Farmers worried
about cash shortage whose effects could ripple throughout the farm
economy.

The Agriculture Department said it had been on top of the drought
since March 1; monitoring the situation, setting up hotlines, and
issuing a "USDA Backgrounder" updated every two weeks listing the
Department's "drought-related" actions.  By mid-July, the drought had
shifted eastward from the Rockies to the Mid-Atlantic with little
relief in sight.  29% of the nation was undergoing severe drought.  In
August, the Agriculture Department confirmed that the drought would
curtail the Fall corn harvest by a third or more, resulting in higher
prices for years to come.  However, crop stockpiles were so high that
there was no fear of shortages on grocery shelves or discontinuance of
food exporting.  Also, President Reagan signed a $3.9 billion drought
relief program to help farmers survive to plant the next Spring.

A new computer study reported at the end of 1988 that the drought in
the Midwest might have been caused, April through June, by ocean
temperature abnormalities near the Pacific equator.  By the end of
1989, the $3.9 billion drought relief program of 1988 became an
unexpected election-year windfall for thousands of farmers, when cash
was paid far beyond original intent to save them from bankruptcy.  The
program broadened at each step, adding hail, flood, heat, insect,
wind, and fungus damage.  Loose regulations, lax enforcement, and
politicians trying to be recognized in an election year as friends of
farmers were the main reasons for the generosity.  The 1988 drought
hit hardest in the upper Midwest where most of the aid went to North
Dakota, the nation's most agriculturally dependent state, which lost
two-thirds of its hard-red Spring wheat crop.  Despite the overly
generous relief aid, money did reach areas that Congress most intended
to aid, where it kept farmers on their land and might have prevented
some business closures.  A late 1990 Agriculture Department analysis
of nine "drought region" prices rose and farm solvency still
improved.</SUM>
