Police brutality received national attention following the airing of
the videotaped beating of Rodney King by four Los Angeles Policemen
back in March.

A commission appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley and Police Chief Daryl
Gates in the wake of the videotaped beating was issued yesterday. The
commission found that a significant number of officers use excessive
force against Los Angeles residents, a problem exacerbated by racism
and bias in the department.

The brutal beating of King offers convincing evidence that a code of
silence exists within that department. The four officers who took
turns hitting and kicking King would not have dared their brutality
had they feared that any of the 17 others officers watching would
report their criminal actions.

Another videotape being shown among activists nationwide shows Los
Angeles police officers intentionally hurting the nonviolent
demonstrators they are arresting.

In-mid June, a lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department was
settled when police agreed to stop using a martial-arts weapon,
nunchakus, against anti-abortion advocates.

Los Angeles is not the only city faced with claims of police
brutality.  In many cases the accused officers are cleared by their
own internal affairs investigators.  They may only be prosecuted if
there are eyewitnesses to the arrests or the incidents are caught on
videotape.

In one case in Santa Clara, California when the suspect was so badly
injured that he required hospitalization, the arresting police officer
was only arrested and charged after eyewitnesses came forward.

In Chicago, blacks alleged they were the victims of police brutality
accused officers of unprovoked beatings, false arrests, intimidation
and insulting them with racial slurs.

In Minneapolis, in January, allegations of police racism and brutality
shook the city following the deaths of two blacks at a drug raid that
went awry.

The City Council in Long Beach, California, asked county prosecutors
to investigate the conduct of a white policeman who was secretly
filmed while he pushed an off-duty black policeman through a
plate-glass window.

While in Kansas City, in June, several white officers bloodied a
Nigerian-born Roman Catholic priest with nightsticks as he lay on the
ground. In May, another black clergyman was hit on the head with a
shotgun by a white officer while lying on the ground.

Finally, over the past two years, the Ventura County, California
district attorney's office in four separate incidents has declined to
prosecute suspects who contended that they were victims of police
brutality by Oxnard officers.</SUM>
