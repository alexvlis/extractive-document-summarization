In 1988 the Republic of Slovenia was a small one-party communist state
within a federation of communist states dominated by Serbia. By 1994
Slovenia was an independent market-oriented, multi-party parliamentary
democracy. The transition was not easy and the tiny nation was not
without problems, but the accomplishment was remarkable. Even before
1988 the Communist government of Slovenia was not afraid to criticize
the way the authoritarian federal government dealt with the country's
economic and social problems. Serbia's intolerance of Slovenia's
relatively liberal outlook came to a head in December 1989 when Serbia
banned all political and economic contacts with Slovenia.  Uncowed,
Slovenia in the spring of 1990 went on with scheduled multi-party
elections which resulted in a new government led by a coalition of
center-right parties that called for full sovereignty within a loose
confederation.  Negotiations among the six republics failed and in
June 1991 Slovenia seceded from the Yugoslav federation. Federal
military intervention followed, but tiny Slovenia was able to
negotiate a peace agreement and emerged with full independence but
serious economic problems caused by the severance of relations with
Serbia and continuing warfare elsewhere in Yugoslavia. By 1994 these
problems remained but Slovenia worked diligently to develop markets in
the rest of Europe.</SUM>
