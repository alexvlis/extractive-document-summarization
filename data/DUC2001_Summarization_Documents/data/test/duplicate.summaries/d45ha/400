It was no surprise that Yugoslav federal military commanders met on
March 25, 1988 to consider ways to quell dissent in Slovenia and
concluded that "dissident tendencies" in Slovenia were part of a
foreign-backed conspiracy to overthrow the country's Communist
government. Slovenian Communists had frequently criticized the way the
federal government dealt with the country's economic and social
problems and some army commanders had complained that Slovenia's
leadership had failed to act firmly against political dissidents. But
at the time of the March meeting the military commanders did not
discuss any plan of action against Slovenia.

Although liberal, prosperous and tiny Slovenia and the hard-line
communist leadership of giant Serbia had been fighting for years,
matters came to a head in December 1989 when Serbia banned all
political and economic contacts with Slovenia. At issue were
Slovenia's demand for regional autonomy within a loose confederation
and its scheduling of multi-party elections. Serbia insisted on a
centralized federation with a single Communist Party. In June 1990 a
coalition of center-right parties formed a new Slovenian government
and in July parliament declared the republic's full sovereignty, but
stopped short of calling for secession. The hard-line Communist
government in Serbia vehemently opposed the idea of a confederation as
well as western-style democracy. The stand-off continued until June of
1991 when, after months of unsuccessful negotiations among leaders of
the six republics, Slovenia and Croatia seceded from the Yugoslav
federation. Federal forces were quickly mobilized and moved against
Croat and Slovene police and militia. Slovenia negotiated a peace
agreement, but fighting in neighboring Croatia continued.

Independent Slovenia faced major economic problems. Large foreign
exchange deposits were frozen in the former National Bank of
Yugoslavia. Slovene enterprises had always relied on sales in
Yugoslavia and cheap Serbian raw materials to support exports to the
rest of Europe. Severance of relations with Serbia and warfare in
Croatia had reduced Slovene exports to Yugoslavia by 85%.  Although
there were signs of a softening of the antagonism between Slovenia and
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, by 1994 no one was predicting a
normalization of relations. Although the outcome was not clear, the
Slovenian Republic persevered in its efforts to promote trade with the
rest of Europe and development into a full-fledged market-oriented,
multi-party parliamentary democracy with hopes of joining the European
Community, the World Bank, and the international Monetary Fund.</SUM>
