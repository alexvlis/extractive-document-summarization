Between May 1988 and October 1994 assassins struck in Tunisia, the
Philippines, Columbia, Egypt, India, Lebanon and Mexico. The
circumstances surrounding the killings differed, but all were
politically inspired.  In South Korea investigations were still going
on in 1994, looking into the role of the then Army Chief of Staff in
the assassination of the country's president.
 
The assassination rate in Columbia might have sent an unsought after
record of sorts.  Three presidential candidates were killed in
separate incidents between August 1989 and April 1990 it was widely
held that the Medellin drug cartel was behind the killings. The
government had launched a United States-backed crackdown on the drug
dealers, and the cartel was intent on intimidating the
government. During the nine month period cited above the drug
traffickers murdered nearly 300 Columbians, and has brought to the
brink of political chaos.

Rajiv Gandhi, Prime Minister of India between 1984 and 1989, was
assassinated in May 1991 while campaigning to serve again. His name is
the most familiar of those assassinated between 1988 and 1994.  His
grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was India's first Prime Minister, and
his mother, Indira Gandhi, was Prime Minister from 1966 to 1977, and
again from 1980 to 1984, when she, too, was assassinated.  The
killings in Egypt, Tunisia and Lebanon carried overtones of the
intrigues and grudge-holding that marks that part of the world. In
Egypt the 1990 assassination of the leader of the Egyptian parliament
was blamed on Iraqi agents, carrying out the order of Saddam Hussein
who considered Egypt a traitor nation for supporting the United States
in the Gulf War.  The second in command within the PLO was killed in
Tunisia, and unidentified Israeli official said that an Israeli squad
was responsible.  The PLO charged that the United States cooperated in
the slaying. The 1994 assassination of a Jordanian diplomat in Lebanon
was blamed on terrorists aided by Jordanian fundamentalists sponsored
by Iran.  A candidate for the presidency of Mexico was assassinated in
March 1944, and a second prominent politician was killed six months
later. Both victims were reform-minded. The assassinations proved that
Ernesto Zedillo, the incoming president, would face fierce opposition
from reactionaries and traffickers if he tried to fight corruption.

Communist rebels were suspected in the July 1989 assassination of the
Chief of Police of Makati, the financial center of the Philippine
Islands.</SUM>
