Ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a
controversial issue in 1992 and 1993.  Congress had to ratify the
treaty, which would establish free trade among the United States,
Canada, and Mexico, by January 1, 1994.  Supporters of NAFTA spent
millions of dollars and were characterized by one person as the
"elite".  They included Clinton and his administration, the Republican
leadership, the business community, and stock market investors who
feared protectionism and an economic decline.  The supporters mandated
additional packages aimed at the environment, labor rights, job
assistance programs, and the establishment of a North American
Development Bank.  These moves brought support from some
environmentalists and some U.S.  Hispanics.  William Daley, from the
Chicago Daley political family, was named NAFTA czar.  He was a
skilled, behind the scenes negotiator, with labor ties.  Opponents,
characterized as the "populists," included many democrats, labor union
members who feared lost jobs and lower wages, Ralph Nader and his
Public Opinion group, Ross Perot, U.S. Hispanics who feared recent
immigrants would be the first to lose jobs, some environmentalists,
many blacks, and ultra-conservatives.  The opponents ran a grassroots
operation with a small budget.  Jim Jontz was the anti-NAFTA czar and
established national, regional, and state organizations.

As early as June 1992, public opinion did not support NAFTA.  This
support continued low, with early September 1993 polls showing 66% of
Americans did not support it.  Fifty percent of Americans believed
more jobs would be lost than gained and 54% believed wages would go
down.  As the November 18 vote grew near, Clinton began making
impassioned speeches and inviting representatives to the White House,
administration officials visited districts of undecided
representatives, and government agencies distributed pro-NAFTA
literature.  Clinton's credibility and future effectiveness became
tied to the ratification.  The opposition continued rallies, marches,
meetings, labor union exhibits, and speeches by workers who had lost
their jobs to Mexico.  Vice President Gore won a NAFTA debate with
Perot and popular opinion began to shift.  One poll in early November
put support at 57%.  Each side began claiming almost enough votes to
decide the issue and undecided representatives and their constituents
were strongly lobbied by both sides.  Anti-NAFTA forces declared that
they had only their personal votes to give, while Clinton had been
promising local projects to secure support.  Following ratification of
the agreement, Caribbean basin nations waited warily to see its impact
on them.</SUM>
