Earthquake deaths in 1988 were the most since 1976.  An Armenian quake
accounted for the majority: 25,000.  Earthquakes of magnitude 6, 7, or
8 are referred to as significant, major, or great, with the latter
capable of tremendous damage.  The strongest earthquake ever recorded,
a magnitude 9.5, happened in Chile in 1960.  Japan is also very
seismic and large numbers of its people would be in great danger if a
big quake were to strike.  Predicting that an earthquake is imminent
is not believed possible by most scientists but several areas have
been tagged as likely to have a big earthquake in the years
ahead.</SUM>
