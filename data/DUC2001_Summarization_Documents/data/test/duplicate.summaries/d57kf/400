Earthquake deaths in 1988 were the highest since 1976.  An Armenian
quake accounted for most of the deaths that year, killing 25,000.
Although the death toll was higher, the number of significant quakes
was fewer than the previous year.  A "significant" earthquake is one
recorded at magnitude 6; an earthquake of magnitude 7 is considered
"major" and capable of heavy damage.  A magnitude 8 earthquake is a
"great" quake, capable of tremendous damage.  Chile is the most
seismic country.  It has 2,270 miles of coast on an earthquake fault.
That country also had the strongest quake ever recorded: a magnitude
9.5 in 1960.  It killed 5,000 people in a sparsely populated area and
caused a section of coast to drop nine feet.  Tsunamis from it caused
damage as far away as Japan.  Several significant and major quakes
occurred in 1989, including one south of San Francisco, an area,
according to the US Geologic Survey, that was ripe for a significant
quake and one that has high chance for a significant quake by the year
2018.  That same year, a major quake hit the Solomon Islands and a
great quake hit the Macquarie Islands south of Australia.  Because
these are sparsely populated and not developed, no major damage was
recorded.

Scientists who study earthquakes have not yet developed the ability to
warn than an earthquake is imminent and most believe that it is
impossible to pick the exact date.  Iben Browning picked the dates of
four large earthquakes in 1971 and predicted a major quake for the New
Madrid, Missouri area for December 3, 1990.  New Madrid was the site
of one of the largest earthquakes in US history.  Browning based his
prediction on tidal forces caused by the positions of the sun and
moon.  Four moderate earthquakes did occur on December 3rd, but none
were in the New Madrid area.

Earthquake experts in Japan, a very seismic country, believe the
Tokyo-Tokai area is overdue for a big quake.  The area is heavily
populated and a major rupture in the Tokai section, which last
occurred in 1854, could endanger up to ten million people.  The Tokai
area has a dense array of geophysical instruments that exists nowhere
else in Japan.  Few have hopes of predicting an earthquake and
skeptics in Japan believe the Tokai project is money wasted and
misleads the people.</SUM>
