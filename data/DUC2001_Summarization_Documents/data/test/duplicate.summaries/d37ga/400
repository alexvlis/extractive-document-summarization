Analysis of assassinations mentioned in selected news accounts
1988-1994 shows that their motivation can be placed into three
categories: internal political; ethnic/religious; and criminal/drug
related. Examples of internal political struggles were found in the
Philippines and South Korea. In July 1989 Col.  Herminio Taylo, 54,
police chief of Makati, twin city of Manilla, was assassinated by
members of the New People's Army, the same group that killed Col. Rowe
of the Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group earlier in the year. Taylo
was the tenth soldier or policeman slain in the Manilla area in a
period of two weeks. The incident in South Korea pertained to an
earlier assassination--that of President Pak Chong-hui in October 1979
by then Central Intelligence Agency Director Kim Chae-kyu.

Assassinations by rival religious or ethnic groups occurred in the
Arab world and India. In April 1988 Khalil Wazir, the PLO second in
command, was assassinated in Tunis, apparently by Israeli agents.  In
October 1990 Rifaat el- Mahgoub, Egyptian parliament speaker, was
assassinated, apparently with the involvement of Iraqi agents,
Palestinian extremists of the Abu-Nidal group, and Egyptian Moslem
fundamentalists. Nine years earlier Islamic extremists assassinated
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.  In January 1994 Jordanian diplomat
Na'ib al- Ma'ayitah was assassinated in Beirut in a joint effort by
the Palestinian Abu-Nidal group and a Jordanian fundamentalist group
financed by Iran. In India elections were postponed in May 1991 after
the assassination of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, apparently by a
Tamil separatist guerilla force, Tigers of Tamil Eelam, that has
assassinated dozens of political enemies. Rajiv Gandhi became prime
minister in 1984 after the assassination of his mother, Indira Gandhi,
by Sikh militants. Many assassinations in Latin America seemed to
involve drug traffickers. Prior to the presidential election in
Colombia in 1990 three candidates, Carlos Pizarro, Bernardo Jaramillo,
and Carlos Galan were assassinated apparently with the connivance of
the Medellin drug cartel although that group specifically denied
involvement in Pizarro's death. In Mexico reform- minded presidential
candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) was assassinated in March 1994 in
Tijuana. There was speculation, but no hard evidence, that the
perpetrators were political reactionaries and drug traffickers. In
October 1994 Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the number two official in
the ruling PRI, was assassinated by a federal deputy of the PRI and a
former tourism developer with strong links to the Gulf drug cartel in
Tamaulipas.</SUM>
