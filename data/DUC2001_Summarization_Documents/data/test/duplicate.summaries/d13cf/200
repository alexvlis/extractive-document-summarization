Clarence Thomas grew up in Pinpoint, Georgia.  He had a loving mother,
but was deserted by his father.  Thomas says his grandparents who
raised him, are responsible for his achievements.  He attended an
all-black Catholic school and a Seminary in Missouri hoping to become
a priest.  Anti-black attitudes of some there led to his departure
after one year.  At Holy Cross College, Thomas joined black protesters
and admired Malcolm X.  Admitted to Yale Law School while an
affirmative action program was in effect, Thomas began his transition
to the conservative philosophy.  Missouri Attorney General Danforth
picked Thomas from Yale for his office.  Thomas also worked for
Danforth when Danforth was a senator.  Thomas was Chairman of the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for eight years where his
anti-affirmative action views angered many in the civil rights
movement.

Thomas became a judge on the US circuit court of Appeals and, when
Justice Thurgood Marshall retired from the Supreme Court, President
Bush nominated him to fill that opening.

Virginia Thomas, Clarence Thomas' white wife has a record of her own
on issues which might come before the court.  Both Thomases believe
women and minorities have been hindered by affirmative action.

Leola Williams, Thomas' mother, celebrated his confirmation by singing
a spiritual.</SUM>
