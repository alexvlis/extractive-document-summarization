Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas is a product of harsh southern
roots.  He grew up in Pinpoint, near Savannah, Georgia.  He had a
loving mother but was abandoned by his father and was raised by
grandparents.  Thomas credits those grandparents with shaping his
views on individualism and responsibility for his achievements. Thomas
attended an all black Catholic school.  As a youth, he shared the
liberal attitudes of many bright young blacks.  Thomas entered a
Seminary in Missouri hoping to become a priest, but the anti-black
attitude of some fellow seminarians ended his stay there.  At Holy
Cross College, Thomas joined Black protesters and had a wall poster of
Malcolm X in his room.  Thomas' transition to his present ideology
began while at Yale Law School where he was admitted while an
affirmative action program was in effect.  Some critics attribute his
move to conservatism as opportunism.  Missouri Attorney Danforth
recruited Thomas from Yale for his office.  Later, when Danforth
became a senator, Thomas became a member of his staff.  Thomas was
Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for eight
years where he battled with the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.
He made an enemy of the AARP who said that he let legal protections
for the elderly lapse.  Senator Pryor, Chairman of the Senate Special
on Aging set the number of cases so affected as 15,000.  Thomas became
increasingly identified as opposed to affirmative action and other
civil rights orthodoxy.

Thomas was made a Judge on the US Circuit Court of Appeals in the
District of Columbia.  With the retirement of Justice Thurgood
Marshall from the Supreme Court, President Bush nominated Thomas for
his position.  Some saw his nomination as a black for a black, which
Bush strongly denied.  With the exception of Thomas' opposition to
affirmative action, senators have little else on which to assess his
views.  Democratic and Republican Senators differ on the extent to
which Supreme Court nominees should have their views brought out in
confirmation hearings.

Virginia Thomas, wife of the nominee, is seen as a woman with strong
opinions on issues which may come before the Court.  Some blacks see
Clarence Thomas' marriage to a white woman as a rejection of the Black
Community.  Both Thomases believe that women and minorities have been
hindered rather than helped by affirmative action.

Leola Williams, Thomas' mother, celebrated his confirmation by singing
a spiritual and reciting the 23rd Psalm.  Local townsfolk had
supported Thomas during the hearings.</SUM>
