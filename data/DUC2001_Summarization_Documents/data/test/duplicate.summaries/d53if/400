Shining Path ("Sendero Luminoso"), a Maoist guerrilla organization
founded by Abimael Guzman gained its initial foothold in Peru's Upper
Huallaga Valley.  They found support from farmers there who switched
from coffee and cocoa to growing coca to satisfy the US demand for
cocaine.  Under a state of emergency in 1984-1985, the Peruvian army
controlled the area and prevented the anti-drug police from doing its
work under the US-financed Peruvian anti-drug campaign.  After the
state of emergency, Shining Path gained the farmers' favor and became
their defenders since the police had mistreated the peasants when they
came to eradicate the coca crop. Shining Path imposed its own
revolutionary justice by banning prostitution, homosexuality, thievery
and drug abuse even though they encouraged coca production as an
income source but only for shipment out of the country.  Shining Path
took a fifth of the coca profits and enforced harsh penalties for any
breaking of the rules.

Shining Path began to move into the cities and coastal areas and
expected support from the poor because of the economic collapse and
super inflation of Peru. The guerrillas combined conventional politics
with terror. They called for a boycott of the runoff vote between free
market activist Llosa and engineer Fujimori to replace President
Garcia.  Garcia noted Shining Path insurgency moving into Lima after
two car bombs exploded near Government Palace.  One governmental
committee chairman said that violence comes from humiliation,
oppression, class hate, and racism as well as poverty.  Estimates are
that nearly 20,000 lives were lost in the war between the government
and Shining Path.  Also a death squad, the Rodrigo Franco Command, has
vowed to kill a Shining Path member or sympathizer for each person
killed by the guerrillas.

Peruvian police did discover a Shining Path archive and memorabilia
repository and, while a minor coup, fell short of the Interior
Minister's claim that the war was almost over.  Shining Path founder,
Abimael Guzman, who had not been seen for several years and was
believed to have died, did resurface and was imprisoned along with
other Shining Path leaders.  Those leaders have presented a peace
proposal to the government that would call for a surrender of weapons
and a general amnesty.  President Fujimori, who had promised to wipe
out Shining Path by 1995, admitted that talks had been held.  Shining
Path leaders not in prison, led by "Comrade Feliciano", vowed to
continue its struggle.</SUM>
