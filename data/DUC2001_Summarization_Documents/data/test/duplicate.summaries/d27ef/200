The Second Amendment to the Constitution generated much discussion and
argument before it was adopted and, even today, scholars still differ
on it's intent and what it means for gun control.  Virtually all
scholars agree that a citizen's right to gun ownership cannot be
denied by the federal government, but some see ownership dependent
upon serving in the militia.  But, there is not universal agreement as
to what constitutes a militia.  While some see the National Guard as
today's version of the militia, most do not.  Some believe that an
able-bodied armed man is, de facto, a member of the militia.  Most
scholars find nothing in the Constitution that would prohibit some gun
control or registration of weapons, measures opposed by gun advocates
who see registration as an ineffective inconvenience or a ploy leading
to removal of all guns from society.

Despite strong opposition from the National Rifle Association, the US
Congress passed the Brady Bill after seven years.  The NRA has taken
some hits from quarters long aligned with it.  Moreover, gun opponents
have mounted lobbying efforts and have made some headway.  But the NRA
claims that their membership has increased in response to efforts by
gun control advocates, and they are increasing their lobbying
budget.</SUM>
