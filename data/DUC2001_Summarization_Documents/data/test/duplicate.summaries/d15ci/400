The steady decline in tuberculosis (TB) had almost stopped by 1990.
TB is a highly contagious, bacterial lung disease, which is spread by
airborne particles.  As many as 7% of Americans (an estimated 10
million in 1990) are infected with the bacteria, but only about 10%
ever actually develop an active infection.  TB is preventable and
curable, but when it is not treated 50% of the victims die within 2
years.  At-risk people need preventative medication and active cases
must be diagnosed.  The 6-month treatment protocol costs between $30
and $50, but is not readily available in developing countries.
According to the World Health Organization in 1990, TB was the world's
deadliest infectious disease, killing 3 million people annually
worldwide.  In 1993, morbidity and mortality from TB increased in
Latvia.

The increase in TB cases in the U.S. seems to be attributed to the
rise in the number of people infected with HIV, the AIDS virus.
Infected early in life, these people fought off the TB bacteria until
HIV compromised their immune system.  Increases in TB cases also have
been seen in prisons.  A 1989 survey revealed 31 TB cases per 100,000
prisoners, while there were 8 cases per 100,000 non-prisoners.  Also
at higher risk are homeless people, others with poor nutrition, and
those with serious illnesses.  Poor ventilation systems in modern
office buildings have even been identified with increasing the spread
of TB and other infectious diseases.  One 1990 study of nursing home
patients in Arkansas determined that blacks were twice as likely as
whites to become infected with TB, even while living under the same
conditions.  This may suggest that whites have evolved with a better
resistance.  In the U.S. in 1988, TB rates were 4.1 per 100,000
whites, 28.3 per 100,000 blacks, 18.3 per 100,000 Hispanics, and 36.3
per 100,000 Asians and Pacific Americans.

Within the United States, aggressive measures where TB risks are
higher were called for.  The Center of Disease Control recommended
that prisons test for TB, administer chest X- rays, and isolate
victims.  Training in TB prevention and control is needed for staffs
at homeless centers, substance abuse centers, and HIV clinics.
Homeless should be tested and victims placed in residences.  The
preventative drug isoniazid can be administered in drug treatment
centers along with the methadone. For modern office buildings adding
35 cubic feet of outdoor air per minute is recommended, although
expensive.</SUM>
