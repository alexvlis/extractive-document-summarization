The decline in the tuberculosis rate in the United States had stopped,
while internationally it was reported to be the world's deadliest
disease by 1990, killing three million annually.  The prevalence of
AIDS, which impairs the immune system, was blamed. Three million
reportedly had both AIDS and TB, and TB was by then epidemic in
American inner cities.

New York and Newark both reported alarming increases in their
tuberculosis rate, and both cities responded with programs of testing
and treatment.

AIDS experts reported that while progress was being made on a
preventive vaccine, control of AIDS was already possible with existing
drugs.  TB was reportedly readily responsive to an inexpensive drug
treatment even to those with AIDS.

Crowded prisons reported TB rates three times higher than on the
outside, and officials urged testing and treatment, including
isolation of symptomatic cases.

A study in Arkansas nursing homes demonstrated that blacks were more
likely to contract TB than whites in identical situations.  The study
suggested a genetic predisposition.

Office buildings, airplanes, hospitals and prisons, all with little or
no circulation of fresh air, were shown as likely places for airborne
infections such as TB to spread.

Latvia reported a sizable increase in TB cases in 1993.</SUM>
