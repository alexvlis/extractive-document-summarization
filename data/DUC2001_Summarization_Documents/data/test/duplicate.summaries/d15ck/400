The World Health Organization reported in 1990 that tuberculosis was
the world's deadliest disease, killing three million yearly; and said
the number would increase without control measures.

AIDS, which impairs immunity, was blamed.  At that time three million
had both TB and AIDS.

While many people carry either TB or AIDS without getting sick, those
with HIV will likely develop AIDS and higher susceptibility to TB.

While an AIDS vaccine was still being developed, CDC experts said
drugs to control TB were already available.

The Allergy Institute reported an epidemic of TB among inner-city AIDS
patients.  Unlike AIDS, they said, TB is easily transmittable through
the air.

The New England Journal of Medicine recommended treating drug abusers
with AIDS with preventive TB drugs.  Those in their study with TB and
AIDS and treated with isoniazed stayed TB-free.

New York's Health Commissioner reported a 38% rise in TB in 1990.  The
city has added funding for clinics and TB testing for drug abusers,
the homeless and children entering school.

Newark officials also noted a 35% rise in TB cases the previous
year. Meeting there, international health officials noted the increase
here and in Africa and urged clinics to screen for TB, especially
among those with AIDS.

The long decline in the TB rate in the United States had almost
stopped.  From 1981-1984 a 6.7% drop occurred; by 1988 the rate was
only 0.4%.  The CDC blamed the change on high TB rates among the
AIDS-infected, whose immune systems are compromised.  Blacks and
Hispanics, with a higher AIDS rate, accounted for the increase, they
said.

The tuberculosis rate in crowded American prisons was three times
higher than on the outside, according to the CDC, who urged regular
testing for inmates and staff and isolation for confirmed, symptomatic
cases.
  
Another study in the NE Journal of Medicine showed that American
blacks contract TB more frequently than whites under identical living
conditions.  At Arkansas nursing homes, when patients who were
disease-free on admission were re-tested two months later, twice as
many blacks as whites had contracted TB.  Prison data showed a similar
trend.

Office buildings with poor outside air intake were believed fertile
sources of cross- infection among workers: TB, flu, and other airborne
infections could infect widely separated workers, according to health
experts.  Airplanes, prisons and hospitals were felt to be similarly
risky.

Officials in Latvia reported a 14.8% increase in morbidity and a 44%
higher mortality rate from TB in 1993, compared to 1992.  Poor
socioeconomic conditions were blamed.</SUM>
