The following is an account of serious airplane crashes reported
during the period August 1987 to March 1991.

A Northwest Airlines jet crashed in Detroit in August of 1987 killing
at least 154 people.  Engine failure appeared to be the culprit.  In
May 1988, five people aboard were killed when a single-engine airplane
crashed on the outskirts of Albuquerque while trying to land at nearby
Coronado Airport.  High winds may have been the cause.  On 22 December
1988, a Pan Am Boeing 747 apparently exploded in mid-air over
Lockerbie, Scotland, 54 minutes after takeoff from London's Heathrow
Airport.  All 259 people aboard the plane and 22 people on the ground
were killed.  The AP office in London received an anonymous call
saying the crash was retaliation by the "Guardians of the Islamic
Revolution" for the downing of an Iran Air Airbus by a US cruiser back
in July.  In January 1989, authorities questioned the injured pilot of
a Boeing 737 that crashed short of the runway at East Midlands Airport
in England.  There were no clues as to why the plane's undamaged right
engine was shut down while the other engine burned.  A United Airlines
DC-10 crashed short of a runway in July 1989 while making an emergency
landing at Sioux Gateway Airport in Iowa, killing at least 123 of the
293 aboard.  It was speculated that an explosion of the tail engine
was the problem.  In mid-August 1989, the wreckage of a plan that
crashed against a mountain in Ethiopia with Congressman Mickey Leland
and 15 others aboard was found by US rescue and recovery teams.
Indications are that the passengers and crew died instantly.  Leland
was Chairman of the House Elect Committee on Hunger and was on his
sixth tour of refugee camps.  The following day, Congressman Larkin
Smith (D-Miss), known on the House Judiciary Committee as a zealous
opponent of illegal drugs, died in a light plane crash in Mississippi.
A French DC-10 jetliner with 171 aboard blew up at high altitude over
a desert region of Niger in September 1989.  The plane may have been
bombed by terrorists in retaliation against France for sending a naval
task force into Lebanese waters too rescue French nationals in
war-torn Lebanon.  A United Airlines Boeing 707 jetliner crashed near
Colorado Spring Municipal Airport in early March 1991 killing all 25
persons aboard.  There were no indications on why it crashed.</SUM>
