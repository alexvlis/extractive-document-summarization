In 1802 Napoleon advanced the idea of a tunnel under the English
Channel, but the English quickly disabused him of that idea. Since
then there have been abortive starts on a tunnel. The impetus needed
to guarantee the completion of a tunnel came with the imminent
approach of free trade among European nations. A treaty authorizing
the construction of a tunnel was signed in 1986. It was soon dubbed
"the Chunnel".
 
Construction was to be financed by private capital, and no direct
governmental subsidies would be allowed. TransManche Link, a
consortium of French and English companies, would be responsible for
tunnel construction. It would be the biggest European civil-
engineering project of the century. Twenty-three miles of the tunnel
would be under water. The tunnel would emerge from the ground a few
miles inland on both ends, making its length about 31 miles. There
would be three separate adjoining tunnels, a smaller service tunnel
and two larger one-way train tunnels.  i In December digging began
from the French terminal at Sangatte, near Calais, and from the
English terminal near Folkestone. Giant machines simultaneously dig,
remove rock and erect walls. Progress was slow on the English side,
and even slower on the French side where the workers encountered a
more complex geological environment. Even so, by June 1990 the tunnel
was half dug.

France enthusiastically supported the tunnel as a great project in the
national interest, and expected it to resuscitate the lagging economy
in its northeastern sector. In England the tunnel was unpopular from
the start. Some industrialists and trading companies saw a benefit,
but the general public saw it as an evil. They feared that it would
destroy England's insular identity and allow an influx of everything
bad, from rabies to terrorists.  The service tunnel was completed
first, and then the two train tunnels. The "chunnel" was scheduled for
formal opening on May 6, 1994. Construction costs, originally
estimated at 16.7 billion dollars, had risen to almost 16,7 billion
dollars. Nine lives had been lost. The projected rail travel time from
London to Paris would be three and one-half hours. Higher property
values were expected in areas near the tunnel's terminals. Even
Belgium, because of its proximity to Calais, was hoping for a boost to
its economy.</SUM>
