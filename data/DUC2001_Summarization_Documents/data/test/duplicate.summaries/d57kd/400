The major earthquake that struck the San Francisco Bay area Tuesday
occurred in a region seismologists targeted as having the highest
probability of a strong quake in Northern California.

The high probability is based on several factors, including length of
time since the last major earthquake struck the area in 1906, said
Clarence Allen, professor of Geology and Geophysics at the California
Institute of Technology.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey's Earthquake Center, there is
a higher probability of a major quake in the central California town
of Parkfield, where there is a 90 percent probability of a magnitude 6
earthquake by the year 2018.

While some scientist study data to determine the probability of an
earthquake at some future time within a general area, there are others
who feel that they can precisely predict when and where a quake will
occur.

When Iben Browning, a climatologist, predicted that an earthquake
would occur along the New Madrid Fault on a specific date, Schools in
Memphis, Tennessee were closed; some residents purchased earthquake
emergency kits and others left town.  It turned out to be just another
normal day.

In Japan's coastal Tokai region more than 150 geophysical instruments
tracks seismic activity, rock strain, crustal tilt, tidal movements
and ground water levels.  The data are telemetered to Tokyo where they
are monitored around the clock in the hope that experts there will
recognize unusual phenomena that may indicate an imminent earthquake.
However, Waverly Person, chief of the U.S. Geological Survey's
National Earthquake Information Center said, "There's just no way to
predict an earthquake precisely."  "There are no two earthquakes
alike."

If experts could pinpoint when and where earthquakes would occur,
thousands of lives could be saved.

Chile has the distinction of playing host to the largest earthquake
ever measured. On May 21, 1960, an earthquake measuring 9.5 struck an
area about 600 miles long in southern Chile.  About 5,000 people were
killed.

The earthquake that killed 25,00 people in Armenia pushed last year's
earthquake-related death toll worldwide to the highest level since
1976 when a Chinese earthquake killed at least 10 times as many.  The
annual death toll for earthquakes is about 10,000.

An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage, 4
moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, and 6 severe damage.  A 7
reading is a "major" earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage.
The San Francisco Bay area quake measured 7.1 on the Richter
scale.</SUM>
