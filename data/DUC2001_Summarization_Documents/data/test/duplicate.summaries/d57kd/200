The major earthquake that struck the San Francisco Bay area Tuesday
occurred in a region seismologists targeted as having the highest
probability of a strong quake in Northern California.

The high probability is based on several factors, including length of
time since the last major earthquake struck the area in 1906, said
Clarence Allen, professor of Geology and Geophysics at the California
Institute of Technology.

In Japan's coastal Tokai region more than 150 geophysical instruments
tracks seismic activity and other data in the hope that experts there
will recognize unusual phenomena that may indicate an imminent
earthquake.

However, Waverly Person, chief of the U.S. Geological Survey's
National Earthquake Information Center said, "There's just no way to
predict an earthquake precisely."

If experts could pinpoint when and where earthquakes would occur,
thousands of lives could be saved.

Chile has the distinction of playing host to the largest earthquake
ever measured. On May 21, 1960, an earthquake measuring 9.5 struck an
area about 600 miles long in southern Chile.  About 5,000 people were
killed.

The earthquake that killed 25,00 people in Armenia pushed last year's
earthquake-related death toll worldwide to the highest level since
1976 when a Chinese earthquake killed at least 10 times as many.  The
annual death toll for earthquakes is about 10,000.</SUM>
