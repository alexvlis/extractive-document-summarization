Marathon racing was a popular sport from 1989 to 1991.  The race, 26.2
miles long, usually includes competition by men, women, and both sexes
in wheelchairs, and sometimes is run in conjunction with shorter
races, such as half marathons.  Half marathons alone also are run.
The wheelchair winners have the best times--under 2 hours, with the
men's winner usually finishing 10 to 15 minutes later, and the women's
winner about 20 minutes after that.  The winning finishing times in
individual city marathons vary by as much as 5 minutes, depending on
the quality of the competitors, terrain, and weather for the day.

Prize money for these winners varies widely.  The 1989 Chicago
marathon paid $50,000 to the men's and women's winners.  The San Diego
International Marathon, the same year, paid each only $5,000.  The
Boston Marathon in 1991 had $402,000 in total prize money.

Competitors in U.S. marathons come from all over the world.  African
nations, especially Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia, have contributed
many winning male runners.  Ethiopians are especially successful
because they train at high altitudes to enhance aerobic capacity.  On
one April 1989 weekend, Ethiopians won three major marathons.  Mexican
runners also are especially successful, as are Northern European
women.  One of the two fastest female marathoners, as of 1991, was
from Norway.  She won the 1989 Boston Marathon, finishing 26th
overall, which was believed to be the highest overall finish for a
woman in this race.  Asian runners, male and female, are strong in
West Coast races.

The professionals are by no means the only participants.  Races draw
thousands of runners.  Thirteen thousand were expected for the 1991
Boston Marathon.  One of them was an 83 year-old man who would be
running his 60th Boston Marathon.  He won the race in 1935 and 1945
and finished second seven times.  His time in 1990 was 5 hours and 5
minutes.

Amateur interest in marathon racing is strong and can be unusual.  In
1990 a naval officer on a battleship deployed in the Middle East
planned to run his marathon in 75 laps around the deck, while his wife
and father ran the Marine Corps Marathon in Washington, D.C.  Marathon
vacations became popular by the early 1990's.  Tour companies offered
clients marathon packages including airfare, hotel, and race entries
to locations throughout the world.  One company took 5,500 people on
20 different tours in 1990.  Choice locations included European cities
and Bermuda.</SUM>
