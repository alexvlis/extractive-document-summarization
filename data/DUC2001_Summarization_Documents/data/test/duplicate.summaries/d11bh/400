Tornadoes, violently twisting winds reaching down from thunderclouds,
occur as winter transitions to spring. Hot weather stirs the air and
helps form thunderstorms. Tornadoes increase in March and are most
common in May and June but can occur any month. The November average
is 23 storms, but in 1988, unusually warm, wet November weather
triggered 121; and on November 15, 1989, tornadoes were reported in 13
states and killed at least 27, including 17 in Huntsville,
Alabama. Tornadoes are most frequent between 3 and 6pm and least
likely just before sunrise, although an April 1988 tornado hit
Madison, Florida, at 4:30am and killed four.

The typical tornado is 50 yards wide, heads northeast at an average
speed of 30 mph, and travels two miles on the ground. Single large
thunderstorms are likelier to produce tornadoes than groups of storms
which compete to rotate. Most strong tornadoes are actually 6-7 small
ones rotating around a larger tornado's center. Tornadoes are most
likely to occur in the thunderstorm portion adjacent to large
hail. Tornadoes are impossible to redirect or squelch. They tend to
concentrate in regions for 5-6 years. Less than 2% of tornadoes are
classified violent. The longest on record went 219 miles in March
1925. The largest single outbreak was in April 1974 when 148 killed
300 people in 13 states over two days.

Tetsuya Theodore Fujita has studied tornadoes for 42 years and creates
miniature tornadoes in his lab. A bottom fan makes a swirling motion
and a top fan simulates a low- pressure system's updraft. His Fujita
Scale ranks tornado strength, with zero meaning breaking twigs and
five meaning ripping up houses.

1990, one of the worst years for tornadoes, saw at least 726 in the
first six months, including a March tornado reaching 300 mph, and 101
touching down the first weekend in June.

Tornado deaths are decreasing with greater public awareness and better
warning.  Computers now make many sources of data accessible and the
national weather service provides continual updates. A tornado watch
means conditions are suitable for development of tornadoes. A warning
means one has already developed. In case of a tornado, people should
go underground or to a central part of a building, squat or lie flat,
and cover their heads, since most fatalities are from flying
debris. If in a car or mobile home, they should get out and go to a
safe shelter or a low area.</SUM>
