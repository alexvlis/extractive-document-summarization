Tornadoes, violently twisting winds reaching down from thunderclouds,
usually occur as winter transitions to spring. They increase in March
and are most common in May and June. They usually occur between 3 and
6pm and are least likely just before sunrise but can occur any month
and any time.

Typically tornadoes are 50 yards wide, head northeast at 30 mph, and
travel two miles on the ground. Single large thunderstorms are
likelier tornado-producers than groups of storms competing to
rotate. Most strong tornadoes are actually 6-7 small ones rotating
around a larger tornado's center. Tornadoes occur most often in
thunderstorm portions adjacent to large hail. Tornadoes are impossible
to redirect or squelch. Less than 2% are violent. The Fujita Scale
ranks tornado strength from zero (weak) to five (violent).

Tornado deaths are decreasing with greater public awareness and better
warning, aided by computers accessing many data sources. A tornado
watch means conditions are suitable for tornado development. A warning
means one has developed. In case of a tornado, people should go
underground or to a central part of a building, present low profiles
and cover their heads. If in a car or mobile home, they should leave
it for a safe shelter or low area.</SUM>
