Debate and intensive lobbying over the North American Free Trade
Agreement went on for years before its final passage in
1993. Originally proposed during the administration of George
H. W. Bush the measure was finally approved by Congress in the
administration of Bill Clinton with the active support not only of
President Clinton and former President Bush, but also former
presidents Carter and Ford. Opposition to the measure was largely from
environmental and labor groups who feared that the agreement would
result in a massive loss of jobs to Mexico as employers took advantage
of that country's lower wages and less stringent environmental
regulations. The struggle to get the measure approved by the US
Congress resulted in strange political bedfellows with Republicans
overwhelmingly supporting the measure as Democratic President Clinton
went all out lobbying to get 40% support from Democrats in
Congress. Usually loyal Democrat Gephardt opposed NAFTA while
Clinton's nemesis Newt Gingrich supported it. Effective grassroots
work by organized labor and environmental groups and high visibility
support from sometimes presidential candidate Ross Perot created
impressive public opposition to the trade pact, but negotiation of
ameliorating side agreements on labor and environmental questions and
effective lobbying of Congress eventually won the day for the
pro-NAFTA forces.</SUM>
