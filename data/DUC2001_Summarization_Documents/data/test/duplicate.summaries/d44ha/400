By June 1992 the prospects for the proposed North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) which had seemed so bright just a few weeks before
became clouded. The proposal supported by President Bush, the
Republican establishment, the prospective Democratic presidential
nominee, and much of the Democratic congressional leadership now faced
growing opposition from followers of independent presidential
candidate Ross Perot and from leaders of organized labor who warned of
massive job losses to Mexico. The environment/farm/labor coalition had
acquired 200 signatories in the House to a resolution conditioning
approval of the pact on strong environment and food safety
provisions. It was too late to get congressional approval of NAFTA
before the fall elections and with public opinion apparently swinging
against the proposal there was no way to judge what the sentiment on
trade would be in the new Congress.

A year later with Bill Clinton now President the situation was no
clearer.  Hispanic groups that had been counted upon to support NAFTA
found their members divided, preventing the Hispanic congressional
caucus from taking a stand.  Hispanic business organizations supported
the pact but citizen groups feared that Hispanics in the US would bear
the brunt of the negative impact and demanded side agreements
protecting against environmental and labor abuses. As the summer
progressed anti-NAFTA forces concentrated their lobbying efforts on
the general public while pro-NAFTA efforts zeroed in on undecided
congressmen and on the side agreements that might win over dubious
legislators. By September polls indicated that 36% of respondents
opposed while only 25% supported NAFTA.

Successful negotiation of protective environmental and labor side
agreements and intensive lobbying of Congress led by William Daley won
over several wavering votes in support of NAFTA, but as the November
17 vote in the House drew near the only certainty was that the vote
would be close. A decisive win by Vice President Al Gore over NAFTA
opponent Ross Perot in a widely televised debate seemed to help the
NAFTA cause as a poll of debate watchers showed that their support of
the pact had shot up from 34% before the debate to 57% after it.
Lobbying by both sides intensified.

Within a few months of the passage of NAFTA, before its effects could
really be judged, countries of the Caribbean basin were asking for
"parity" with Mexico which would effectively extend the
agreement.</SUM>
