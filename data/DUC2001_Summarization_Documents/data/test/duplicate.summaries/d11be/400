According to media reports of 1988-91, National Weather Service
records and other sources have indicated that most tornadoes occur
between noon and 6 P.M.  They also travel from southwest to northeast.
A thunderstorm next to large hail is often the spawning area where
tornadoes begin.

The arrival of spring in Texas and the U.S. heartland often brings
with it the tornado season.  May is the peak month for tornadoes.  To
keep loss of life and property damage to a minimum, the National
Weather Service advises people to be familiar with a safety plan
before a tornado strikes.

On 19 April 1988, the residents of Madison, Florida experienced the
fury of a tornado that cut a 12-mile swath through the middle of this
town of 3500 people.  Mobile homes took the brunt of the tornado's
fury.  Other adjacent counties in Florida and the neighboring state of
Georgia were also hit by hail, high winds, heavy rain and tornadoes.
Once again, a number of mobile homes were destroyed or damaged.

Although the most dangerous period for tornadoes is in the spring,
they can also occur at other times of the year.  On 15 and 16
November, 1988, for example, a series of tornadoes and thunderstorms
with high winds struck the Mid-Atlantic, Great Lakes and Southeast
area states.  Seventeen died and 514 were injured.  Damage was in the
millions. Flooding also occurred in some of these areas.  One city,
Huntsville, Alabama, took the major portion of the casualties with 17
killed, 463 injured and 1000 homeless.

Tornado watches for the two days of 15 and 16 November reached as far
north as the Northeast.

The year 1990 was particularly notable for its disastrous tornadoes
and floods in the Midwest and Southeast.  An above-average 726
tornadoes touched down.  Flooding in the South and Plains added to the
loss of life and property damage.  One plus factor was the use of
computers for the watch, warning and response system which kept the
death and injury total low.

In 1990, Tetsuya Fujita was a science professor at the University of
Chicago.  He was one of the world's authorities on tornadoes.  He
helped to define the conditions that develop tornadoes and originated
a scale for tornado measurement.  He was instrumental in deploying
doppler radar at airports so that strong air currents could be
detected and air crashes avoided.</SUM>
