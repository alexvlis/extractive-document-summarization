Weather Service and other records have yielded valuable data
concerning the pattern of tornado occurrences in the U.S.

Spring in Texas and the U.S. heartland brings the tornado season. The
Weather Service advises people to have safety plans before tornadoes
strike.  A particularly dangerous tornado occurred on 19 April, 1988
when it cut a 12-mile swath through the town of Madison, Florida.  The
neighboring state of Georgia was also struck.

On fewer occasions, tornadoes have occurred at other times of the
year.  On 15 and 16 November 1989, for example, a dangerous series of
tornadoes, thunderstorms and high winds struck the Mid-Atlantic, Great
Lakes, and Southeast area states.  Huntsville, Alabama took the major
portion of these casualties.  Tornado watches for the two days
extended as far north as the Northeast.

1990 was notable for its disastrous tornadoes and floods in the
Mid-West and Southeast. Floods occurred in the South and the Plains.

Tetsuya Fujita, a science professor at the University of Chicago in
1990, became one of the world's foremost authorities on tornadoes.  He
developed a scale to measure tornadoes.  He also pioneered the
deployment of doppler radars at airports so that aircraft could avoid
dangerous air currents.</SUM>
