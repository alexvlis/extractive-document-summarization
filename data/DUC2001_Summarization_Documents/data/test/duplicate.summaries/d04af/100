Hurricane Andrew was responsible for seventeen deaths in Florida and
Louisiana and caused probably $15B in damages.  Southern Florida,
especially Dade County suffered the most devastation with one in every
eight homes destroyed and 150,000 homeless.  In Louisiana, Andrew
missed New Orleans and most of its damages were to rural areas.
Insurance claims could run to $8B against US companies and another
billion for British companies.  Many homes and businesses in Florida
were not insured.  Federal assistance for Andrew's victims, the
responsibility of the FEMA, was not timely or adequate.  President
Bush visited the area and promised assistance.</SUM>
