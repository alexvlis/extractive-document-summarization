Hurricane Andrew was the costliest US natural disaster.  Southern
Florida, especially Dade County, was the hardest hit by Andrew but
Louisiana also received a share of the devastation.  Fifteen deaths in
Florida were attributed to Andrew.  Louisiana had two deaths and three
had also been recorded earlier in the Bahamas.  Andrew left at least
150,000 homeless in Florida and a week after the storm, 275,000
remained without electricity.  One in every eight Dade County homes
had been destroyed. Florida's alligator industry and cotton and sugar
cane crops were threatened.  It was initially feared that Andrew might
hit New Orleans which is especially vulnerable since it lies below sea
level, but the storm made landfall 60 miles west of there.  Damage in
Louisiana was mainly in rural areas and oil refining facilities
escaped with only a brief shutdown because of loss of power.  Many
offshore oil platforms had been evacuated as the storm approached.

US insurers were expecting to be hit with over $7B in Florida claims
with the greatest impact on State Farm, Allstate, and American
International.  Louisiana claims would bring the US insurers total to
nearly $8B. British companies, with a much lesser share of the
hurricane insurance market in the Gulf area might sustain claims of
$1B.  One British company, General Accident, still believed that
losses might reach a level at which external catastrophe reinsurance
covers might be breached causing it a post tax loss of $40M.
Insurance claims, in general, do not appear proportional to the great
devastation of Andrew, in large part because many homes and businesses
were uninsured.  Total losses for both insured and uninsured could
reach $15B.  Wall Street has remained calm in the face of Andrew's
damages.

Local officials in Florida were highly critical of delays in supplying
food, drinking water, and other items.  Federal officials acknowledged
problems and President Bush ordered troops to Florida.  The Federal
Emergency Management Agency was blamed for most of the federal failure
to act promptly and adequately.  FEMA was saddled with many political
appointees, had no planning and was, thus, totally unprepared to deal
with a disaster.  Measures were underway to "shape-up" that agency.
President Bush made a second trip to the area of Florida devastation
and generated some good will by a promise to rebuild Homestead Air
Base which had been leveled.  That promise and other "largess"
appeared to lessen any possible harm to Bush's re-election
campaign.</SUM>
