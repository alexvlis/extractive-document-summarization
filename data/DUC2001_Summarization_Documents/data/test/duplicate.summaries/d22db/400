Each year in the United States, tens of thousands of forest and brush
fires will burn hundreds of thousands of acres in national parklands
and forests.  The fire season is the hot, dry months of summer and
early fall.  These conditions, when coupled with high winds, make it
extremely difficult to control or contain a fire once started.
Normally, major fires will occur in every western state.  In 1989, the
largest fire in the lower 48 states burned over 12,000 acres in Utah's
Diamond Peak area.

Although lightening starts the majority of these fires, many are
caused by human carelessness such as campfires, fireworks or hot
vehicle exhaust systems.  A significant number are intentionally, and
illegally lit --- arson.  The Forest Service employees 125 criminal
investigators.  Their job, in addition to investigating crimes such as
growing marijuana in the forests and the theft of federal property, is
to investigate arson.  Through July of 1988, 172 of the 296 fires in
Missouri's Mark Twain National Forest were attributable to arson.

In 1972 the National Park Service began its "natural burn" policy,
which allows lightening-induced fires to burn themselves out, except
where they threaten towns or park buildings.  In September 1988, after
the worst fire season ever in Yellowstone National Park, a panel
recommended to the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior that until
the Forest Service and the National Park Service improve and
coordinate their fire management plans, fires not be allowed to burn
freely.  Critics claim this controversial policy was responsible for
allowing fires to destroy half of Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres.

Controversy also exists as to what our practice should be following a
major forest fire.  Some believe that allowing a hands-off "natural"
reforestation policy is best.  Others believe that human intervention
by seeding and planting trees helps the forest recover much faster.
Everyone agrees that a new forest cycle is beginning that will enable
a greater variety and greater numbers of plants, birds and animals to
flourish until the forest matures and canopies over.

Major fires can be grueling and expensive events.  In July 1989, the
Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho, which coordinates federal
firefighting efforts, listed 7,000 to 7,500 people on fire lines,
along with 42 air tankers, 14 guide planes and 10 helicopters.
Furthermore, the millions of dollars in destroyed vehicles, homes and
structures, not to mention lost timber often exceed these firefighting
costs.</SUM>
