Each year, primarily in western States, tens of thousands of fires
will burn hundreds of thousands of acres in national parklands and
forests.  Although lightening starts most of them, many are caused by
human carelessness; arsonists also start a significant number.  The
Forest Service employees 125 criminal investigators whose job is to
investigate arson and other crimes on federal lands.

The National Park Service follows a "natural burn" policy, which
allows lightening- induced fires to burn themselves out, except where
they threaten towns or park buildings.  In 1988, a panel recommended
that this policy be halted until the Forest Service and the National
Park Service improve and coordinate their fire management plans.  Also
questioned is what our practice should be following a major fire.
Some believe that a hands-off "natural" reforestation policy is best.
Others believe that human intervention by seeding and planting trees
helps the forest recover much faster.

Major fires are expensive.  In July 1989, the Boise Interagency Fire
Center in Idaho, listed 7,000 to 7,500 people on fire lines, along
with 42 air tankers, 14 guide planes and 10 helicopters.  Furthermore,
the millions of dollars in destroyed vehicles, homes and structures,
not to mention lost timber often exceed these firefighting
costs.</SUM>
