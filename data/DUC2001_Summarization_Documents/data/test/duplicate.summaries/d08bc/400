A solar eclipse occurs when the moon positions itself between the
earth and the sun.  When the sun is totally blacked out by the moon's
shadow the eclipse is said to be total.  Scientists who studied an
ancient clay tablet found in Syria concluded that it recorded a solar
eclipse that occurred in 1213 B.C., making it the oldest known record
of a total eclipse. Some researchers say that the Chinese may have
recorded one as early as 2137 B.C. An eclipse is illusionary because
the sun, although 400 times larger than the moon, appears to be
covered by the moon, and that because the moon is 400 closer to the
earth.

Total eclipses are visible from any single location roughly every 400
years. Eclipses have provided opportunities for serious scientific
studies. The presence of helium in the sun was first detected during
an 1868 eclipse. The 1919 eclipse offered confirmation of Einstein's
theory that the path of light is bent by gravity.

A total eclipse on March 18, 1988 moved along a 108 mile-wide swath
from the Indian Ocean across Indonesia and the Southern
Philippines. The eclipse was partial across a wide area of Asia and
parts of Australia. Another total eclipse on July 21, 1990 and blacked
out the sun from Southern Finland across the Kola Peninsula and the
northern part of the Soviet Union to the Aleutian Islands. Residents
of parts of western North America viewed a partial eclipse on March 7,
1989.

Most total eclipses get little attention because they occur in
isolated areas. The eclipse of July 11, 1991 received enormous
attention. Preparations in Mexico went on for over a year. It was
called "the solar eclipse of the century". It reached from Hawaii
through Mexico and Central America to Brazil, passing through one of
the world's most populous regions, and putting 40 million people in
its path. Darkness in some areas lasted almost seven minutes, the
longest possible duration for a total eclipse. It will be 2132 before
the world sees another eclipse of that duration. Astronomers gathered
in observatories to study the phenomenon. The crowds that flocked to
Hawaii and Mexico would have been much larger if facilities had
allowed. Cloud cover hampered visibility in some areas.  Hawaii got an
extra thrill when, at the height of the eclipse, the Mauna Loa volcano
erupted for the first time in six years.</SUM>
