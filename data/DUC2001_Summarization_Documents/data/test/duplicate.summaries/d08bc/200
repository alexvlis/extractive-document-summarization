A total solar eclipse occurs when the moon is positioned between the
earth and the sun, and its shadow completely blacks out the sun. There
is reliable evidence that a total solar eclipse occurred in Syria in
1223 B.C. Some researchers feel that there is evidence that China
experienced one 900 years earlier. Any particular location on the
earth's surface sees a total eclipse at roughly 400-year
intervals. Scientists have learned from eclipses. The 1868 eclipse
provided evidence of helium in the sun, and the one in 1919 provided
evidence that supported Einstein's theory that gravity bent the path
of light.  In 1988 a total eclipse swept from the Indian Ocean across
Indonesia and the Southern Philippines. One in 1990 crossed Finland,
the Kola Peninsula and the northern part of the Soviet Union. Most
total eclipses occur in isolated areas, but the impressive eclipse in
July 1991 was viewed by 40 million as it passed over Hawaii, Mexico
and Brazil.  Preparations were extensive, and the crowds
responded. Its duration of almost seven minutes was close to the
maximum possible duration for an eclipse. Its path and duration caused
it to be called "the solar eclipse of the century".</SUM>
