In February 1988 some 40 members of Congress, largely from states with
few illegal aliens, and the Federation for American Immigration Reform
proposed that illegal aliens be excluded from the count in the 1990
census that would be used for reapportionment of Congressional
seats. They argued that these people were not legal citizens and
should not be represented in Congress. Debate in the House and Senate
pitted these advocates of exclusion against Congresspeople from states
with large populations of illegal immigrants and others who argued
that exclusion would violate the constitutional requirement that
representation be based on the "whole number of persons" residing in
the various states; that there was no precedent for exclusion; that
many federal aid programs were based on these census figures, and
states most influenced by the surge in immigration would lose funds
needed to deal with attendant problems; and attempts to determine
whether immigrants were legal would discourage all immigrants from
cooperating with the census.

In 1989 the Senate twice voted in favor of exclusion. In each case the
House refused to accept the Senate's verdict, so finally the matter
was referred to Senate-House conference and on October 19, 1989 the
negotiators agreed that illegal immigrants would be counted in the
1990 census.</SUM>
