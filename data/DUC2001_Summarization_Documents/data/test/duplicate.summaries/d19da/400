In February 1988 some 40 members of Congress joined with the
Federation for American Immigration Reform to press for exclusion of
illegal aliens from the count in the 1990 census that would be used
for reapportioning Congressional seats. The group contended that
including the estimated 2 million or more illegal aliens would cause
unfair shifts of seats from one state to another.

Debate in the House and Senate pitted members from states with few
illegal aliens (favoring exclusion) against those from states with a
large number of undocumented immigrants (opposing exclusion). The in
favor claimed that counting illegal aliens would violate citizens'
basic right to equal representation by giving greater voice in
Congress to states where aliens live. It would violate the principle
of one man, one vote. It was not right to grant representation in
Congress to individuals who had entered the U.S. by breaking its
laws. One proponent of exclusion declared that counting illegal aliens
"...may be constitutional, but it's just not right."

Census officials and those opposed to the exclusion had an advantage
in arguments based on the Constitution, precedent and legal
reasoning. The Constitution instructs that House apportionment be
based on the "whole number of persons" residing in the various states
and does not use the term "citizen" in this regard although it is used
elsewhere in the Constitution. This interpretation was upheld by a
federal court in a ruling prior to the 1980 census. All past censuses
had counted all the "persons" residing in the states. Furthermore, the
Census Bureau termed the exclusion unworkable since they had no means
to determine who was legal and illegal and any attempt to find out
threatened the chance of cooperation from immigrants. Aside from
reapportionment there was a practical consideration for states that
had experienced a surge in immigration: they had enormous additional
costs and needed available federal aid based on the census figures.

In July 1989 the U.S. Senate voted for an immigration bill calling on
the Census Bureau to exclude illegal aliens from the count. The House
blocked the measure in August.  Despite strong opposition from the
Bush Administration, in September the Senate attached a similar
amendment to the appropriations bill for the State Justice and
Commerce departments. The bill was referred to a Senate-House
conference and on October 19, 1989 the negotiators announced that
illegal aliens would be counted in the 1990 census.</SUM>
