The military aircraft in the U.S. arsenal vary in purpose, size,
speed, technology and age.  They operate from hundreds of airbases
around the world and aircraft carriers at sea.  Flying them can be
dangerous, even fatal.  Aircraft crashes are not uncommon.  In the
period from June 1988 through April 1994 innumerable crashes have been
reported world wide--two F-16 fighter jets on a training mission near
Bodenheim, Germany; an F-16C in a remote area of Iwate Prefecture in
Japan; a Navy F-14 fighter plunging into the Atlantic of Hatteras,
North Carolina--and many more.

Local and national press coverage is extensive when a crash occurs in
or near a densely populated area.  In September 1988 a crippled Navy
plane crashed into a hanger at Gillespie Field in El Cajon,
California.  Its two crewmembers were able to guide it toward the
airbase runway before bailing out.  The jet passed within a mile of an
elementary school and narrowly missed a nearby restaurant.
Fortunately, there were only injuries, no fatalities.  The residents
of Remscheid, West Germany were not as lucky when a U.S. Air Force
A-10 Thunderbolt crashed into a working class neighborhood killing six
people and severely injuring seven.  The accident further eroded the
already sinking public support for Germany's national defense
programs. Even before this fatal crash, 12 major military aircraft
accidents had killed 95 people that year alone in Germany, including
70 deaths at an air show accident at the U.S. airbase in Ramstein.
 
Two weeks after the Remscheid crash, another A-10 Thunderbolt crashed
in Britain.  Ironically, this model aircraft has the safest flying
record in the U.S. arsenal.  It experiences an accident rate of less
than 4 Class A mishaps per 100,000 flying hours.  A Class A mishap is
one in which there is either a fatality or damage to an aircraft
exceeding $500,000.

In 1990, the estimated 700 warplanes in Saudi Arabia as part of the
Operation Desert Shield buildup were given clearance to fly again
after a rash of five crashes within two months prompted the military
to ground all except operational flights for 24 hours.  Investigators
found no common causes or contributing factors in the accidents.

Most recently, a 1994 crash in Okinawa prompted the Japanese Defense
Facilities Administration Agency to ask the command of the U.S. Forces
in Japan to take thorough measures for the safe management of the
U.S. military bases in Okinawa.</SUM>
