Confounding predictions of its demise four years ago during the worst
diamond slump since the 1930s, De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the
South African concern that controls 80% of the world's uncut-diamond
market, is thriving.  De Beers' Central Selling Organization, known as
the Syndicate, is the pipeline between diamond mines and dealers based
mainly in Antwerp, Belgium; Bombay, India; Tel Aviv, Israel, and New
York.  Some analysts warn, however, that De Beers' future may be
affected by the surge in diamond output elsewhere, notably Australia.
World diamond production has soared to 88 million carats from 47
million carats in 1982.

The Opperheimer family empire face other concerns as well.  The black
majority in South Africa threatens De Beers largely because of a newly
energized political will.  The African National Congress has pledged
to nationalize South Africa's major sources of wealth if it takes
power.

Meanwhile in London, the Office of Trading is investigating the
anti-competitive practices of De Beers.  Complaints suggest the De
Beers have a monopoly on diamond trading in London.

The break-up of the former Soviet Union caused still another
concern. De Beers signed a five billion-dollar contract for uncut
diamonds in 1990 with the former Soviet Union.  After a break-up of
the Soviet Union the De Beers contract was continued with
Rosalmazzoloto with hopes that the new government would work well with
De Beers.

In Botswana some politicians want to change De Beers' exclusive sales
contract so that part of their country's output can be sold
independently of the South African group's international cartel.
While a rush for diamonds by miners in Angola and Canada are
threatening the De Beers cartel. In Canada's Northwest Territories
where 81 small diamonds were found, prospectors are laying claim to
every piece of land within 300km of the discovery.  In Angola, more
than $1 million worth of diamonds a day are being smuggled out of that
country for sale in Antwerp.

While De Beers have been faced with some uncertainly over the control
of the uncut diamond market, other ventures are giving them more
power.

Venetia is De Beers' newest diamond mine.  Last year the mine more
than doubled output and processed 3.6m tons of ore to recover 4.96m
carats. The mine has revitalized De Beers' production and accounts for
half the output in South Africa and replaces production from its
100-year-old Kimberley mines.</SUM>
