Large wildfires occurred in the Western mountains in the 1700s and
probably at 200-300 year intervals over the past 10,000 years. In
1926, wildfires destroyed 28 million acres.

In 1977, the Sycamore Canyon fire near Santa Barbara destroyed 200
homes and led to the realization that extent of devastation is related
to landscaping. Six of California's 10 most damaging wildfires have
occurred since 1980, reflecting residential development pushing
farther into hills and canyons, creating conditions for bigger fires
with more property loss, that are expensive to put out.

In 1985, fire destroyed 100 acres and 12 homes in Los Altos Hills,
where residents repealed an ordinance requiring fire-retardant
roofs. A fire above Lexington Reservoir blazed for six days, scorching
14,000 acres and destroying 42 homes.

In 1987, 900,000 acres burned in California. 1,500 fires attacked
Klamath National Forest near the Oregon border in one month, with a
strong inversion layer trapping thick smoke in a valley. Firefighters
breathing the smoke 24 hours a day sickened in record numbers.

1988, the most expensive fire season in US history, saw 25,000
firefighters called in and $583.8 million spent to fight 75,000
fires. 5.9 million acres burned in the South, California, and the
Pacific Northwest, with severest fires in Alaska and Yellowstone.
Record drought conditions, heat, gale-force winds, and tinder build-up
produced Western fires that scorched 5 million acres. Some blazes were
triggered by man.  Yellowstone's fires burned 706,000 of its 2.2
million acres over four months and gave 12,000 firefighters
respiratory problems. 80% of burned trees were lodgepole pines. The
"let-burn" policy was lifted in July. One-quarter inch of rain and
snow on Sept. 11 stopped the fires.

From January-July 1989, 1.3 million acres had burned in the contiguous
US (compared to 2.1 acres by July 1988.) In late July, 10,000
firefighters battled hundreds of blazes, most sparked by lightning. In
early August, 102,000 acres in Idaho and 118,000 more in Oregon,
California and Utah were ablaze.

In 1990, brush and trees "damaged by drought, bark beetles, and a rare
fungus" fueled rapid and intense fires in Santa Barbara that destroyed
600 homes and did $200 million damage. By August, 15,000 Yosemite
acres were scorched. 170 fires burned in Oregon's Umatilla National
Forest.

An October 1991 firestorm devastated the Oakland hills. Water to fight
it disappeared as electricity failures shut off pumps. In the Saratoga
foothills, nine fires were deliberately set June through
October.</SUM>
