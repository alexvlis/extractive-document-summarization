The nation's police forces were plagued in the late 1980s and early
1990s by racism, brutality, intimidation and false arrest.

The conduct of one of these police forces, the Los Angeles Police
Department (LAPD), was anything but exemplary.

Typical of one if its operations gone awry was an incident at Los
Angeles Airport.  A policeman falsely arrested Joe Morgan, a retired
major league infielder, for drug trafficking because he was black.

The beating of Rodney King on videotape prompted a number of
investigations of the LAPD.  These investigations concluded that the
LAPD was riddled with racism and brutality and called for the
resignation of its chief, Daryl Gates.  He agreed to step down in
1992.

In 1990-91 the LAPD, as well as the forces in 49 other U.S. cities,
were confronted with a new dilemma: how to handle non-violent,
anti-abortion demonstrators.  The LAPD decided to apply "pain
compliance" techniques, twisting arms, etc., in getting protesters to
comply.

The situation became so serious by 1991 that the Chief of Police in
San Jose felt compelled to speak out about a code of silence among
other police chiefs.

Meanwhile, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department was successful
in maintaining a low profile--until his own officers became involved
in four shootings and committed robbery.
  
The Long Beach Police force was also having its problems.  A white
policeman pushed a black man through a plate glass window after a
traffic stop.  The incident was videotaped in a sting operation set up
by the black man, an undercover police sergeant.

Other police forces had the same problems.  In Chicago, blacks charged
the police with brutality, intimidation, beatings and false arrest.

The Minneapolis Police force was charged with racism and brutality in
the deaths of two blacks.
  
In Kansas City, Missouri, the charges were excessive force and
racism. One incident involved a black priest who was attacked by
police while on the ground.

A Santa Clara attorney described a case of police brutality involving
a high speed chase.  When apprehended, the suspect was mauled by
police.  When the brutality was covered up by police, four witnesses
came forward and the policeman was prosecuted.

In a twist of irony, the Ventura County district attorney's office
refused to prosecute suspects arrested by police who claimed police
brutality and filed charges.  Reasons for dismissal included a "lack
of evidence."  Police brutality circumvented the justice system in
these instances.</SUM>
