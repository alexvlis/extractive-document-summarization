A recent Gallop survey found that 61% of Americans, regardless of
party, race, sex, ideology or income, favor congressional term limits.
Rarely has there been an issue with so little demographic variation
among the public.  70% of House Members oppose the idea.  Why this
dissatisfaction with Congress?  Six focus groups in three states spoke
out.  Average citizens feel they are not being heard in Washington and
they are losing confidence in the electoral process.  They believe
that Washington politicians are more concerned with political
self-preservation than with the public good.  During the prior three
elections 96% or more of House incumbents who ran for re-election won.
People feel that incumbent legislators have carefully crafted a web of
perks and privileges that makes challenging them a futile crusade.
Therefore, many people feel the only way to chuck the rascals out is
with term limits.

We once had term limits during our early nation building years.
However, they were unanimously rejected by the constitutional
convention and the First Congress defeated two subsequent term-limit
proposals.

Although popular with the public, many political scientists believe
term limits are a bad idea, akin to burning down your house to get rid
of the rats.  Lawyers also question the constitutionality of term
limits.  The constitutional argument is that neither the states nor
Congress may add to the age, citizenship and residency qualifications
set forth in the Constitution.  Proponents of change argue that term
limits are not a qualification.  They do not prevent anyone from
having the opportunity to serve in Congress, nor do they prevent
anyone from voting their ideology or party.  The California Supreme
Court has ruled that term limits for state officeholders is legal.
And the U.S. Supreme Court has reiterated that states, via the Tenth
Amendment, have "the power to regulate elections".

Many political scientists think the crux of the problem---entrenched
arrogance, more concern for special interests than the common people,
and obsession with campaign financing---is caused by the tenured
committee system.  Seniority provides better committee assignments,
which lead to greater special interest fund raising and the power to
control government largess.  Perhaps term limits on committee
assignments would address voters concerns and negate the need for
office limits.  But there will still be those who believe that a true
"citizens Congress" should be comprised of legislators on temporary
leave-of-absence from real world work, and not by career
politicians.</SUM>
