Foresters say the heavy rains that have pelted California in the past
two weeks have worsened the threat of fierce forest fires this summer
because they will stimulate the growth of grasses that later dry and
become fuel for wildfires. Unless an unusually cool summer intervenes,
this summer could become one of the worst wildfire seasons in
California's history.  Firefighters are most concerned about rural
areas of the South Bay and East Bay where people have built homes
among heavy vegetation.

In 1988 drought conditions and high winds help make it the worst year
in hundreds of years for wildfires. The U.S. Forest service said 5
million acres were charred in the raging blazes, including 706,000
acres in Yellowstone National Park.

Wildfires are a major environmental concern but they also put at risk
the 80,000 men and women that battle the wildfires. Their health is
under siege from the poisonous stew of gases and soot in wildfire
smoke. Health experts suspect that exposure to that smoke may
accelerate aging, prompt fatal heart attacks or cancer and trigger
respiratory diseases such as chronic bronchitis or asthma.

As this summer's wildfire season approaches, firefighters are
wondering not whether, but only where and when.</SUM>
