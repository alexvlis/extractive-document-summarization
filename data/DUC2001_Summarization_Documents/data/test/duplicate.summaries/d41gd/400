Foresters say the heavy rains that have pelted California in the past
two weeks have worsened the threat of fierce forest fires this summer
because they will stimulate the growth of grasses.  The grasses will
turn paper-dry by July helping to spread fires quickly through trees
and brush killed and weakened by five consecutive years of drought and
by insects which more easily invade dry wood than moist.

The December freeze in California killed heavy brush and millions of
trees that are now primed to burn.  Unless an unusually cool summer
intervenes, these are the ingredients for what could become one of the
worst wildfire seasons in California's history.  Firefighters are most
concerned about rural areas of the South Bay and East Bay where people
have built homes among heavy vegetation.

While little can be done to control the natural fires that occur,
homeowners can change their approach to landscaping and help improve
the chances of their homes and property surviving a brush fire.  While
no plant is fireproof, some are more flammable than others.  A line of
defense against fire can be designed into landscaping by carefully
selecting the plants that that will go in the garden around the home.

In 1988 drought conditions and high winds help make it the worst year
in hundreds of years for wildfires. The U.S. Forest service said 5
million acres were charred in the raging blazes, including 706,000
acres in Yellowstone National Park.  The Forest and National Park
Service spent a combined $300 million fighting the summer fires.

Despite the infernos that whipped through the treetops like blast
furnaces, most of the pristine landscape in Yellowstone emerged
unscathed.

Wildfires are a major environmental concern but they also put at risk
the 80,000 men and women that battle the wildfires. Their health is
under siege from the poisonous stew of gases and soot in wildfire
smoke.  Among the culprits are carbon monoxide, which slows reaction
and impairs judgement; microscopic particles of carbon that lodge in
the lungs; aldehydes and acids that irritate air passages,
hydrocarbon-bases substances and other chemicals that can damage genes
and cause cancer, test show. Health experts also suspect that exposure
to wildfire smoke may accelerate aging, prompt fatal heart attacks or
cancer and trigger respiratory diseases such as chronic bronchitis or
asthma.

As this summer's wildfire season approaches, firefighters are
wondering not whether, but only where and when.</SUM>
