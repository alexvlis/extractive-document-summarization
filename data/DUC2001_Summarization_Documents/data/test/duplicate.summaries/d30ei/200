From 1987 to 1993, hunger was endemic in Asia, Africa, and much of the
Americas and one billion people lived on less than $1 a day.  There
was some progress in Asia by 1993.  The Third World debt grew $151
billion from 1987 to 1991.  In 1984, Third World nations were paying
more in debt service fees each year than they received in loans.  In
1987, small U.S. banks began to write off Third World debts, something
large U.S. banks could not afford to do.  Although there were people
who blamed the debt crises on the Third World governments, developed
nations, which in 1988 were spending very little to help, were asked
to cancel or reschedule debts and increase financial aid.  The World
Bank was expected to lead in solving these problems and gradually
moved from its traditional bank role as a development--not
financial--institution that rarely intervened in crises.  In 1990 the
bank began emphasizing programs that eased poverty and helped the
environment and in 1991 began to link loan volume to a country's
efforts to fight poverty.  In 1993, there had been some progress.
Some success in easing poverty was seen with private foundation
programs called micro-enterprise lending (or village banking).</SUM>
