From 1987 to 1993 poverty prevailed throughout most of the Third World
as the debts of Third World nations grew.  In 1988, the Foreign
Minister of Brazil declared that hunger was endemic in Asia, Africa,
and much of the Americas.  In 1991 one billion people were living on
less than $1 a day.  By 1993 there was some progress in Asia, with the
percentage living in absolute poverty dropping to 10%, but in Africa
this ratio rose to 50%.  The Third World debt in 1987 was $1.19
trillion and in 1991 it was $1.341 trillion.  In 1984, Third World
nations began to pay annually more in debt service fees than they
received in loans.  By 1989 the debt service costs were $50.1 billion.
This massive debt and many nations' inability to pay, created in 1987
two U.S. banking groups--smaller, regional institutions that could
write off loans or place them on a non-accrual basis and large, major
banks with thin reserves that could not afford to do that.

Developed nations were asked to cancel or reschedule debts and
increase financial aid.  In 1988, industrial nations spent an average
of 0.34% of their GNP on helping developing nations.  Some, including
Lord Bauer of Britain, blamed poverty on the poor nations and decried
allowing loan defaults.  The World Bank was expected to lead in
solving these problems.  In the late 1980's the bank president
supported a traditional bank role as a development--not
financial--institution, loaning to countries pursuing economic
reforms, maintaining statistics and issuing reports, and rarely
intervening in national crisis.  In 1990 the bank began to move toward
emphasizing programs that eased poverty and helped the environment,
but in 1991 critics still recommended moving from structural
adjustment loans and not forgiving debts to emphasis on infrastructure
investment and direct poverty relief.  The new bank president directed
the staff, in 1991, to link loan volume to a country's efforts to
fight poverty.  More money would go to those governments with stronger
commitment to reducing poverty.  In 1993, he noted there had been some
progress.  In 1982, 5% of loans had a poverty focus, while in 1992
almost 50% did.

Micro-enterprise lending (or village banking) began to boom in the
period.  Foundations, with support from the U.S. Agency for
International Development, were giving very small loans to villagers
for grassroots enterprises, exporting free-market economics, and
fueling growth.  Repayment of these loans exceeded 90%.</SUM>
