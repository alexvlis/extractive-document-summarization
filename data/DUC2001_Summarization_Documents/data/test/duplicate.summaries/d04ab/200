Hurricane Andrew slammed across southern Florida and then continued
into Louisiana where damage was limited because the storm narrowly
missed low-lying New Orleans and the major oil industry complexes
along the coast and offshore.  In Florida, wind gusts up to 165 mph
left a ten-mile wide swath of death and destruction about 25 miles
south of Miami.  The town of Homestead, including a local air force
base, was largely flattened.

Total storm damage may exceed $20 billion, most of it not insured.  US
property-casualty insurers expect to pay an estimated $7.3 billion in
Florida alone.  This year, counting $3.9 billion for the LA riots and
a series of tornadoes, plus Florida's Hurricane losses, the industry
total rises to $11.2 billion.  This far exceeds the record $7.6
billion paid in 1989 for Hurricane Hugo and California's Loma Prieta
earthquake.  Because US property- casualty insurers recently have
purchased less foreign reinsurance for catastrophes, they alone will
incur most of Andrew's losses.  Authorities believe they have adequate
funds to cover the disaster.

After a poor initial response, President Bush seems finally to be
getting disaster aid to those in need.  He has pledged to rebuild
Homestead AFB and has sent the military to Florida.</SUM>
