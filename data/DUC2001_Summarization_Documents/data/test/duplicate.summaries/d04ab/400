US insurance companies face their largest claims losses ever as a
result of damage caused by Hurricane Andrew.  After tearing through
the Bahamas, causing extensive property damage and taking three lives,
Andrew slammed into southern Florida causing massive damage and the
loss of fifteen lives.  It then continued into the Gulf of Mexico,
where it eventually made landfall 60 miles southwest of the city of
New Orleans.  Losing force as it moved across land, Andrew was
downgraded to a tropical storm once it's winds dropped to below 75
mph.  Louisiana damage was limited because the brunt of the storm
narrowly missed low-lying New Orleans and the major oil industry
complexes along the coast and offshore.  However, other Louisiana
industries such as oysters, alligators, cotton and sugar cane are
affected.  One person died, dozens were injured.

The greatest losses occurred in Florida, where wind gusts up to 165
mph left a swath of death and destruction.  Buildings were destroyed,
trees uprooted, power lines snapped and cars smashed.  The greatest
damage is in a ten-mile wide swath through the town of Homestead,
about 25 miles south of Miami.  The town, including a local air force
base was largely flattened.

US insurers expect to pay an estimated $7.3 billion in Florida claims.
This amount does not include claim projections for Louisiana.
Although total storm damage may exceed $20 billion, much of it was not
insured.  Andrew leaves the US property-casualty insurers facing their
worst-ever year for catastrophe losses.  This year, the LA riots and a
series of tornadoes in several states had already produced insured
losses of $3.9 billion.  With Florida's Hurricane Andrew losses added
in, the total rises to $11.2 billion.  This far exceeds the record
$7.6 billion paid in 1989 when the industry paid out for Hurricane
Hugo in South Carolina and the Loma Prieta earthquake in California.

In the end, this disaster may not harm the Presidential election
campaign of George Bush.  After an initial poor, and criticized,
response, Bush seems finally to be getting disaster aid to those in
need.  The attention given by Mr. James Baker and Secretary of
Transportation Andrew Card has helped greatly, as has the arrival in
Florida of the military.  President Bush also pledged to rebuild
Homestead AFB, a major area employer.  While Bush's actions have
enabled him to gain politically, his election rival, Bill Clinton,
could do little more than offer sympathy to storm victims.</SUM>
