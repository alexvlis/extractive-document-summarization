Although there were no dramatic breakthroughs in the treatment of
diabetes during the period 1988-1991 there were some hopeful
developments in research and progress in educating the public as to
steps that can be taken to prevent the disease or to contain it after
its onset. On the research side, in November 1988 Garth Cooper, a New
Zealand biochemist, announced that a newly isolated hormone may lead
to new treatments for the most common form of the disease.  The
hormone amylin is normally undetectable but is found in high levels in
the pancreases of diabetics and appears to be responsible for the
obesity, reduced insulin secretion and the reduced effectiveness of
insulin observed in Type II diabetes.  In 1989 researchers at the
University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, Texas were
working on an anti-diabetic drug called metaforim that seemed to
improve the body's ability to respond to insulin. At the same center
studies of diabetes in Hispanic families were being
conducted. Hispanics are three times more likely to develop diabetes
than the general population and researchers hoped they would
eventually find the gene that triggers the disease.

Studies at the San Antonio center showed that although Hispanics may
have a genetic predisposition to diabetes, diet and lifestyle
contribute to contraction of the disease. Lower-income Mexican
Americans had a higher rate of diabetes than those of higher income
suggesting that diets of cheap, processed foods, lack of exercise and
infrequent medical attention were factors. The researchers encouraged
programs to educate school-age children about the importance of
healthy diets and exercise. The American Diabetes Association and
other health education groups in California took up the challenge. As
early as 1984 there were attempts to promote healthier diets and
regular exercise among Hispanics, but the programs seemed to make
little headway. In 1989 it was estimated that by the year 2000 the
number of Hispanic diabetics in the U.S. would reach 8 million at a
health-care cost of $10 billion a year. In the summer of 1991 health
professionals in the San Jose area opened free nutrition and exercise
classes that expressly targeted the Hispanic lifestyle and emphasized
preparation of traditional Hispanic dishes using polyunsaturated oil
rather than recipes that call for lard. For the first time the classes
were taught by bilingual instructors who could reach the monolingual
Spanish-speaker.</SUM>
