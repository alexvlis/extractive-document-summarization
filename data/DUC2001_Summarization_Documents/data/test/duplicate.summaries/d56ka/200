During the period 1988-1991 there were some hopeful developments in
diabetes research and some progress in educating the public on causes
and means of preventing or containing the disease. The hormone amylin
was identified as a causative agent in reduced insulin secretion and
reduced effectiveness of insulin in diabetics. An anti-diabetic drug
called metaforim was also being tested. At the University of Texas
Health Science Center in San Antonio studies were under way of
diabetes in Hispanic families. Hispanics are three times more likely
to develop diabetes than the general population and researchers hope
to identify the gene that triggers the disease. The center also noted
that lower- income Mexican Americans have a higher rate of diabetes
than those of higher income, suggesting that diet and lifestyle are
factors. The center encouraged programs to educate school-age children
about the importance of healthy diets and exercise. After the failure
of several campaigns directed at California Hispanics, a breakthrough
in educational approach occurred in the San Jose area in the summer of
1991. Free nutrition and exercise classes expressly targeting the
Hispanic lifestyle were offered. Instructors were bilingual and the
nutritional aspects emphasized preparation of traditional Hispanic
dishes using polyunsaturated oil rather than lard.</SUM>
