Although no dramatic breakthroughs occurred in scientific diabetes
research 1988-1991, there was real progress in social aspects of the
disease. Research on Hispanic families with diabetes suggested that
while there is a genetic predisposition to the disease in this
population, its high incidence is due to a large extent to diet and
lack of exercise resulting in obesity. Groups fighting an exploding
diabetes problem among Hispanics in California, after years of
fighting unsuccessfully against Hispanic cuisine in English, tried a
new approach of using bilingual instructors to promote preparation of
the old favorites using polyunsaturated oil in place of lard.</SUM>
