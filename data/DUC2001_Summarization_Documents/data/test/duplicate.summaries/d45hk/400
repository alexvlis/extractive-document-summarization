A Slovenian Chronology:

May, 1988: It was confirmed that Yugoslavian military officials met in
March to discuss dissidents in Slovenia. The agreed-upon plan included
arrest of dissidents and use of force in any resulting protests.

The military denied the plan, which was ultimately blocked by the
Slovenian president.

December, 1989: Serbia cut economic and political ties with Slovenia
after a banned pro- Serbian rally in Ljubljuana was
dispersed. Slovenia called Serbia's action a "declaration of war,"
while Serbia called for the resignation of Yugoslav President Janez
Drnovsek, a Slovene.

June,1990: Slovenia revealed preparation of a constitution allowing it
full sovereignty within Yugoslavia.  Croatia joined its plan for a
loose confederation.

The south, particularly Serbia, accused Slovenia of separatist
tendencies while Slovenia charged Serbia with dominating Yugoslavia.

July 3, 1990: Slovenia's new government proclaimed sovereignty,
declaring an independent legal system, control over armed forces
stationed there, and the intention to create a new constitution, but
stopped short of secession.

The new government, freely elected in June, announced its intention to
join the European Union.

June, 1991: Slovenians declared independence from Yugoslavia. Yugoslav
troops battled militia for two days in Slovenia, surrounding
Ljubljuana's airport. Further south, Serbs fought Croatians.

Both countries vowed to defend independence.

July 1991: Slovenian spirits faltered as their stock market sunk, but
they said there was no turning back.

August,1991: The European Community proposed a peace plan calling for
negotiations with Yugoslavia.

A cease-fire was agreed upon on August 19, but failed the next day.
The plan's provision of a Croat's election to the presidency was
blocked by Serbia, while the army, ordered to stand- down, continued
to oppose Slovene militia.  The plan, devised by Prime Minister
Marcovik and the European Community and accepted by Slovenia, Croatia
and Serbia, crumbled.

March, 1992: Independent Slovenia moved to settle relations with the
Bank of Yugoslavia, establish foreign relations and join the IMF and
World Bank.

May, 1992: With lowered production and exports and high unemployment,
Slovenia sought new trading partners, although some foreign
manufacturers continued to assemble products in Slovenia for later
export.

March, 1993: Slovenia had progressed considerably.  Independent, they
had achieved peace, privatisation and market reforms and no longer had
to support Yugoslavia.  Their goal: a multi-party, market-oriented
parliamentary democracy.

February, 1994: Rumors circulated that Slovenia had sent a delegation
to Belgrade to work at normalization of relations with Yugoslavia, who
denied the report.  Remaining issues are Yugoslavia's distrust of
Slovenia and Slovenia's antipathy toward Serbia.</SUM>
