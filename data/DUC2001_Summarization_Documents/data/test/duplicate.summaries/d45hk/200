A Slovenian Chronology:

May, 1988: Yugoslavia military officials met to discuss dissidents in
Slovenia.  The resulting plans included arrest and use of force to
control protesters.  Yugoslavia denied the plan.

December, 1989: Serbia cut ties to Slovenia after a pro-Serbian rally
in Ljubljana is dispersed.  Slovenia called this break an "act of
war."

June, 1990: Slovenia and Croatia announced preparation of
constitutions allowing sovereignty within Yugoslavia.

Serbia protested Slovenia's "separatist tendencies;" Slovenia
denounced Serbia's attempted domination.

June 28, 1991: Slovenia and Croatia declared independence.  Two days
later, federal troops attacked Slovene militia and airport and closed
borders.

July 10, 1991: Slovenia's Stock Market faltered while the European
Community brokered a plan for Yugoslav-Slovene negotiations.

August 20, 1991: Yesterday's cease-fire faltered as federal troops
moved to subjegate Slovenia and provisions of the cease-fire failed to
materialize.

March, 1992: Independent Slovenia moved to settle economic issues with
Yugoslavia.

May, 1992: Slovenia sought trading partners as they struggled with
issues of exports, production and unemployment.

March 1993: Slovenia's progress since independence include peace,
privatisation, market reform and relief from Yugoslav obligations.

February, 1994: Rumors of a Slovenian delegation in Belgrade to
attempt normalization were denied by Yugoslavia, still distrustful of
Slovenia.</SUM>
