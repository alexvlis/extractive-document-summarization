In 1988, the United States experienced one of the century's worst
droughts.  In the Midwest, large areas suffered their driest
April-June period since 1895.

The USDA set up hotlines for callers and issued informational
statements listing drought related actions taken by the department.
Two early actions were to buy meat for school cafeterias and to extend
credit for Mexico to buy meat.  These purchases helped livestock
markets, which were depressed due to the drought-induced liquidation
of herds.  Drought counties were allowed to conduct emergency haying
and grazing of Acreage Conservation Reserve (ACR) and Conservation Use
Acreage (CUA) lands.  Later, Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land
was also opened.

Congress passed a record $3.9 billion drought relief bill.  North
Dakota, the nation's most agriculturally dependent state, received
$410.2 million, about 10.5 percent of the total package.  The money
helped more than 49,000 farmers in the state and the trickle-down
effect also reduced statewide losses to farm dependent businesses.
North Dakota, along with Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin
received nearly half of the allocated aid.

A 1990 study showed that despite the drought, high commodity prices
enabled farms to improve their solvency in 1988.  And the number of
farms considered financially vulnerable also decreased.</SUM>
