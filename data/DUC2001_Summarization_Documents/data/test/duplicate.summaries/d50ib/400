In 1988, the United States experienced one of the worst droughts of
this century.  Protracted dry weather expanded eastward from the
Rockies into the Great Lakes, the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, and into
the Mid-Atlantic region.  It severely hurt, and in some places
crippled, what started as one of the most optimistic farm years in the
last eight.  In early July, the weather service reported that 29
percent of the nation was undergoing drought conditions.  It was about
equivalent to the drought experienced in 1911, but less severe than
those of the 1930s or 1956.  However, in the Midwest, large areas have
suffered the driest April-June period since 1895.

The Agriculture Department constantly monitored the situation.  It set
up hotlines for worried callers and began issuing informational
statements.  The first statement listed 22 drought related actions
taken by the USDA.  However, only two of them involved the expenditure
of funds, which went for meat purchases for school cafeterias and a
credit arrangement for Mexico to buy meat.  These purchases helped
livestock markets, which were depressed due to drought-induced
liquidation of herds.  Affected counties were allowed to conduct
emergency haying and grazing of Acreage Conservation Reserve (ACR)
land and Conservation Use Acreage (CUA) land.  Later, Conservation
Reserve Program (CRP) land was also opened.

As conditions got worse, Congress passed a record $3.9 billion drought
relief bill.  Being an election year, the bill, originally intended
only for drought relief, was broadened to include floods, heat,
insects, sand, wind, cold and fungus.  Thousands of farmers throughout
the country received an unexpected windfall by collecting millions for
what previously had been considered normal quirks of nature.  In spite
of these misappropriations, the program really did help those who
needed it most.  North Dakota, the nation's most agriculturally
dependent state, received $410.2 million, about 10.5 percent of the
total package.  The money not only helped more than 49,000 farmers in
the state, but the trickle-down effect of payments reduced statewide
losses to farm dependent businesses, banks and households from $3.4
billion to $2.1 billion.  North Dakota, along with Iowa, Illinois,
Minnesota and Wisconsin received nearly half of the allocated aid.

Certain weather researchers believe the drought was caused by
temperature abnormalities near the equator in the Pacific, which
forced the jet stream to shift northward.  If this is true, and such
weather abnormalities can be predicted, then perhaps we can one day
also anticipate impending droughts.</SUM>
