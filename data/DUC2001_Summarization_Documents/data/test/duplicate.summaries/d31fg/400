At the Seoul Olympics in September 1988, Canadian Ben Johnson won the
100-meter dash in 9.79 seconds but was stripped of his gold medal
after a test showed he had used an illegal anabolic steroid called
stanzolol.  He was also suspended from international competition for
two years and banned from Canada's national team for life.  The medal
went to America's Carl Lewis.  Hundreds of Canadians supported him but
most felt shocked and shamed by the incident.  In a published
interview, a fellow Canadian sprinter, Angella Issajenko, said that
Johnson had knowingly taken steroids.  She claimed that Dr. Jamie
Astaphan, Johnson's personal physician, provided the steroids to her
and Johnson with the knowledge of their track coach.  The federal
government called for a judicial inquiry into the Johnson affair.
Dr. Astaphan said Johnson had taken stanzolol four months before the
Olympics and suffered muscle spasms from it, but was not on stanzolol
when he beat Lewis.  He denied he had ever prescribed such drugs to
any athletes.  In mid- June 1989, Johnson testified that his
involvement with illegal performance enhancing drugs included
injections before the 1987 World Championships in Rome.  Carl Lewis
was implicated in alleged sabotage to Johnson's drug test.

Accordingly, testimony at a Canadian inquiry suggested that Johnson
might have drunk contaminated beer inasmuch as Lewis had been talking
to a man who sat near the beer provided to facilitate urine sample.
Linda Huey, an NBC-TV employee and a physical therapist at the Seoul
Olympics, said that Canadian coach, Charlie Francis, claimed that
Johnson's urine sample was spiked with a banned steroid and before the
race said Johnson was "more afraid of failing the drug test than he is
of Carl Lewis."  At a news conference in October 1989, called after
legislation to classify anabolic steroids as a controlled substance
was introduced, Johnson said it was wrong for athletes to use
muscle-building substances.  By September 1990, Johnson's two-year
suspension had ended.

Track meet promoters were eager to sign him up, hoping to fill seats
and rejuvenate interest in track.  He ran in a track meet in Hamilton,
Canada, where he finished second in the 50-meter dash, short of his
record time, but received a standing ovation.  In 1991, the Canadian
coach, Charlie Francis, testified at a federal inquiry that he had
given athletes every steroid combination imaginable.  His system
worked well until Johnson tested positive for illegal steroid use at
Seoul.</SUM>
