Domestic and foreign airlines as well as privately-owned aircraft
suffered a series of air disasters resulting in the loss of many lives
during the period 1960 to 1991.  An examination of selected reports
concerning these disasters reveals that terrorist bombs, mechanical
failures, pilot errors and weather factors have been possible causes.

In the terrorist bombs category, a Boeing 747 was the victim as it
exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland on 21 December, 1988.  Officials
believed it was a terrorist act because of the scattering of wreckage
and the sudden loss of contact with the plane.

Similarly, on 19 September, 1989, a French DC-10 exploded and crashed
after departing Chad.  Once again, the debris field was widely
scattered and air controllers suddenly lost contact with the plane.

Pilot error category included two crashes in 1989.  The first of these
was a Boeing 737.  During flight, a functioning engine was shut down
while a mal-functioning one was allowed to operate.  Flight recorders
confirmed that the crew shut down the wrong engine.  Pilot error also
may have been a contributing cause for the crash of a plane with
Congressman Mickey Leland (D-Texas) and 15 others on board on 13
August 1989.  The plane crashed into a mountain peak in Ethiopia.

Weather factors figured in the crash of a Cessna on 17 May 1988 near
Albuquerque.  The plane nosed into the ground, probably from wind
shear.

Wind shear was also a possible factor on 3 March 1991.  On that date,
a Boeing 737 nosed into the ground near Colorado Springs.  Wind shear
warnings had been issued.

Weather also may have been involved in the crash of a light plane that
claimed the life of Congressman Larkin Smith (R-Mississippi) on 13
August, 1989.

Mechanical failures figured in two prominent crashes in 1987 and 1989.
A MD-82 aircraft crashed on 16 August 1987 in Detroit.  Engine failure
was a likely cause.

There was not much doubt about the cause of the crash of a DC-10 at
Sioux City, Iowa on 19 July 1989.  The plane's tail engine exploded,
there was a complete hydraulic failure, and the right engine failed.

The loss of life and injuries from air crashes reached serious
proportions by 1987.  So much so that there was considerable pressure
for a complete review of air safety measures.  Between 1960 and 1985,
there were ten air crashes by U.S. domestic carriers resulting in 1348
deaths.</SUM>
