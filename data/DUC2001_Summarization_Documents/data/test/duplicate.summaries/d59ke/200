From 1960 to 1991, domestic and foreign airlines as well as some
privately-owned aircraft suffered a series of air crashes.  Causes
included terrorist bombs, mechanical failures, pilot errors and
weather factors.

The terrorist bombs category included a Boeing 747 and a DC-10, both
of which exploded in mid-air.  Because of the scattering of wreckage
and the sudden loss of contact with the planes, bombs were believed to
be the cause.

Two crashes were in the pilot error category.  One was a Boeing 737
whose crew shut down a functioning engine instead of a mal-functioning
one.  In the second instance, a pilot flew a plane into the side of a
mountain.

Weather factors may have figured in the crash of a Cessna.  A Boeing
737 was a wind shear victim when it nosed into the ground in Colorado.

Two crashes of aircraft in 1987 and 1989 were due to mechanical
problems.  A MD - 82 crashed in 1987 because of engine failure.  A
DC-10 that crashed in 1989 had multiple mechanical failures including
two of its engines and its hydraulic system.

Th loss of life and injuries reached serious proportions by 1987.
There was considerable pressure for a complete review of safety
measures.</SUM>
