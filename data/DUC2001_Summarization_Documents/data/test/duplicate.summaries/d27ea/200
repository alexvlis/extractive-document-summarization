The passage of the Brady Bill in November 1993 did not end the debate
over gun control in the United States Congress or in the country at
large. Gun-control advocates pointed to the proliferation of handguns
and assault weapons and the high crime rates in the country.  The
National Rifle Association continued to head up the campaign against
any form of gun control and debate continued to center on the exact
meaning of the Second Amendment to the Constitution.

The Second Amendment states: "A well regulated militia, being
necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to
keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed." Gun-control advocates say
this means the federal government can not interfere with the states'
right to maintain a militia. Opponents say it is a guarantee of
individuals' right to own and use weapons without interference from
the government. The Supreme Court has given no final answer to the
question, but rulings in 1939 and earlier tend to support the
advocates' interpretation. As other gun-control measures are
considered, the debate goes on with one side decrying firearms
violence and the other defending unlimited access to weapons as a
necessity for self-protection and a defense against tyranny.</SUM>
