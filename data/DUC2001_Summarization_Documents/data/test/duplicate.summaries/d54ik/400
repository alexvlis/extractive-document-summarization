During the early 1990s arguments raged across the country for and
against term limits for members of some state legislatures and
Congress.  Several states, including California, Washington and
Colorado, took the issue to referendum.

A feeling of public disgust toward Congress and government emerged,
crossing party lines.  Disenchanted voters felt they weren't being
heard.  Their dissatisfaction had to do with inaction: they wanted
movement on healthcare, taxes and jobs and they wanted some
congressional perquisites eliminated.

A 1990 Gallup-CBS poll showed Americans wanted term limits by a large
majority, crossing lines of race, gender, party, ideology and income.

Advocates for term limits cited the following arguments:

1. Legislature would be less influenced by special interests; the
people would have more control.  
2. Long-term incumbents develop arrogance, lack of accountability and 
a dearth of new ideas.  
3. A citizen Congress would provide better government.  
4. Many incumbents run unopposed.  
5. Term limits would open up politics to blacks, women and other minorities.  
6. Members of Congress spent too much time fund-raising and worrying about 
staying in office.  
7. Incumbents have a huge advantage: access to funds, media, travel and 
mail privileges.
8. A citizen Congress would provide better government.

Those against term limits listed the following reasons:

1. Increased power would go to unelected staff and lobbyists.  
2. New candidates need a huge money outlay to gain recognition.
3. Incumbents are more powerful in relation to special interests.
4. Seasoned, experienced Congressmen's expertise would be lost.
5. Members' inexperience would transfer power to staff, bureaucrats
and lobbyists from whom they must learn.  
6. Good legislators would disappear with the bad.  
7. Term limits would prevent voters from voting for those they favor.  
8. Groups and interests want limits to improve their favorites' chances.  
9. Amateurs would run (California) a huge, diverse state.  
10. Term limits would adversely affect Latinos, favor the moneyed class 
and empower bureaucrats.  
11.Term limits would weaken legislators' incentive to excel.  
12. Term limits are an indictment of citizenship.

T. J. Withal, Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, wrote
in opposition to term limits that the Constitutional Convention
rejected term limits as did the first Congress.

He also remembered that term limits would have unseated Henry Clay and
Daniel Webster 10 years before they wrote the 1850 Compromise, Everett
Dirkson who championed civil rights, and Claude Pepper, who defended
Social Security and Medicare against revenue raids.</SUM>
