Initiatives in several states in the early 1990s to impose term limits
on elected officials elicited much argument for and against such
limits.

Public indignation against Congress and government ran high.  People
felt that their issues: health care, jobs, and taxes, were neglected.
They also wanted some congressional perquisites eliminated.

Indeed, a 1990 CBS/Gallup poll indicated that citizens overwhelmingly
favored term limits, an opinion that, surprisingly, crossed lines of
party affiliation, ideology, race, sex and income.

Arguments favoring term limits included the following:
1. Power would shift away from special interests and back to the people.
2. Legislature would be more accountable, less arrogant.
3. Fewer incumbents would run unopposed.
4. Minorities would gain access to legislatures.
5. A citizen Congress would provide better government.

Those opposed cited the following reasons:
1. Unelected staff and lobbyists would gain power.
2. New candidates need a huge war chest to gain name recognition.
3. Incumbents have more control over special interests.
4. Experience of incumbents would be lost, transferring power to staff
and bureaucrats.
5. Good legislators would disappear with bad.
6. Term limits would prevent voters from voting for whom they wish.
7. Term limits would weaken legislative power.

The speaker of Florida's House of representatives wrote in opposition
that the constitutional Convention rejected term limits as did the
first Congress.</SUM>
