Extensive wildfires within the United States throughout 1988 and 1989
kept firefighters highly active.  Wildfires over the July 4, 1988
weekend were combated mostly in national parks, forests, wilderness
areas, and wildlands in Utah, Montana, Wyoming, Arizona, California,
Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee.  The fires were started primarily by
lightning, fireworks, and vehicle exhaust pipes.  Firefighters
generally followed Forestry Service policy to allow wilderness fires
to burn unless they threatened rails or structures.  In Missouri,
forest officials had studied arson as a cause of forest fires there.
Accordingly, people burned the woods to allow grass to grow for open
grazing, and subsistence farmers claimed fire helped control ticks,
snakes, and disease.  By September of 1988, several forest fires in
the Western states were still underway; namely in Alaska, Idaho,
Montana, Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming, but were under control or not
threatening.  Seven weeks after some of the worst fires ever recorded
in Yellowstone Park, the Park's environmental researchers were
monitoring what they claimed were amazing steps the forest had taken
to renew itself.  They hoped the evidence would testify to the value
of the "natural burn" policy.

Critics have preferred controlled burning, selective logging, and
reforestation.  A panel that reported to the secretaries of
Agriculture and Interior in 1988 recommended a moratorium in the "let
it burn" policy until the Forest Service and National Park Service
could refine management plans.  The panel agreed that there were
benefits to letting wilderness areas burn, but they felt that in some
cases the social and economic effects might be unacceptable.  By
mid-1989, some 31,000 brush and timber fires had been reported in
Utah, California, Colorado, Wyoming, Arizona, New Mexico, Washington,
Alaska, and Georgia.  1,111,000 acres reportedly had burned so far
compared to 765,000 acres last season.  Firefighters contended with
wind and high temperatures at first, but rain and higher humidity
eventually helped.  In California, brush fires apparently started by
people near a roadside store, were finally contained in the Cleveland
National Forest near Lake Elsinore.  An Antelope Valley fire was
contained but six structures were burned as more than 300 firefighters
battled the blaze for three days.  Southwest of Albuquerque, New
Mexico, a creek contaminated by ash from a lightning-caused Divide
fire forced the rescue of hundreds of endangered fish.  Fires were
also contained in Arizona, Nebraska, Wyoming, and in three locations
in Colorado, as well as along the California coastline near Big
Sur.</SUM>
