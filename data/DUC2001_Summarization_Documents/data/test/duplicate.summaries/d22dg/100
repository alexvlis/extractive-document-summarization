Throughout 1988 and into 1989 over 31,000 wildfires had been reported
burning in the national parks, forests, and wilderness areas of twelve
Western states and Michigan, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Georgia.
1,111,000 acres had burned compared to 765,000 acres the previous
season.  Firefighters generally followed the "natural burn" policy,
which researchers at Yellowstone Park were attempting to justify, but
a panel advised a moratorium until management plans could be refined.
Firefighters initially contended with wind and high temperatures but
eventually rain and higher humidity helped contain major fires in
Arizona, Wyoming, Nebraska, at three locations in Colorado, and two in
California.</SUM>
