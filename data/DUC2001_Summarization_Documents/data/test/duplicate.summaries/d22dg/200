Throughout 1988 and into 1989, wildfires kept firefighters active
across the United States.  The fires were extensive in national parks,
forests, wilderness areas and wildlands in Alaska, Washington, Oregon,
Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, California,
Colorado, Nebraska, Michigan, Kentucky, Tennessee and Georgia.
Wildfires over the July 4, 1988 weekend were primarily started by
lightning, fireworks, and vehicle exhaust pipes.  Firefighters
generally followed the Forest Service's "natural burn" policy.
Researchers at Yellowstone Park, which earlier had some of its worst
fires ever recorded, had gathered evidence of forest renewal as
support to their policy.  However, a panel had recommended to the
secretaries of Agriculture and Interior in 1988 that a moratorium
should be declared on that policy until the Forest Service and
National Park Service could refine management plans.  By mid-1989,
some 31,000 brush and timber fires had been reported in nine Western
states and Georgia.  1,111,000 acres had burned up to that time
compared to 765,000 acres the previous season.  Firefighters initially
contended with wind and high temperature but rain and higher humidity
eventually helped.  Major fires were contained in Arizona, Nebraska,
Wyoming, three locations in Colorado, and also in California's Lake
Elsimore area and Big Sur coastline.</SUM>
