Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, or BSE, is commonly known as "mad
cow disease".  The incurable disease eats holes in the brains of its
victims, and in its later stages causes the animals to act jittery and
unstable. The symptoms are similar to those seen in sheep that suffer
from a disease known as scrapie. The sheep version has been around
since the 1700s, but it was first diagnosed in cows in 1986. British
government experts say that processed feed that includes the remains
of diseased sheep has caused the spread of the cow disease. They say
that a certain rendering process allows the infective agent to survive
and victimize the cattle. The feed was banned in 1988, but the disease
continued to strike. The government said that was because farmers
continued to use contaminated feed after it had been outlawed. Some
scientists outside the government and segments of the public refuted
the government's claim.

The spongiform disease has cost the British government several
millions of dollars in compensation to farmers whose cows were
destroyed. As of March 1994 nearly 122,000 cows had been destroyed,
and early on the government promised the farmers 100% of the market
value of each cow destroyed as a preventive measure. The 3.7 billion
dollar British beef industry was threatened by bans on the importation
of British beef into the United States and six other countries. By
1994 Germany was asking the European Union for permission to impose a
complete ban on importation of British beef.

Strains of the spongiform disease have been found in species other
than sheep and cows.  Those include the antelope, the domestic cat and
the larger cheetah and puma. The spread to other species exacerbated
the vocal protests of the British public who were concerned that
humans could be affected. A rare human disease known as
Creutzfeldt-Jakob, or CJD, is similar to BSE. Most scientists insist
that there is no evidence has been developed that links BSE and CJD,
but the 1993 deaths of two British dairy farmers who suffered with CJD
added to the public's unrest. An outbreak of CJD in an area of
Slovakia where sheep abound added to the drive to study the
connection, if any, between the human and animal diseases. American
researchers studied a strange disease among New Guinea tribesmen that
gave victim's brains a spongy appearance, and German researchers
mounted an expensive effort to study the BSE-CJD link.</SUM>
