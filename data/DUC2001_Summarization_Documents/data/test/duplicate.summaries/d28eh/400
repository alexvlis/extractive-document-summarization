The Patriot's Day Boston Marathon's course begins west of Boston in
Hopkinton and ends downtown in Copley Square. Challenges include
little hills five miles into the race, a steep descent, Heartbreak
Hill, and the Haunted Mile where many runners have
collapsed. Marathons from 1988-1990 were reckless speed duels. In 1990
checkpoint records were shattered. Boston's 93rd Marathon in 1989 had
6,418 entrants and hot weather in the high 60s. 1989 winners earned
$45,000. 1991 winners got a medal and $55,000, with a total of
$402,000 in prize money. 13,000 runners were expected for the 1991
marathon April 15th.

of teams from invited countries.

The 12th Old Style/Chicago marathon on Sunday, Oct 29, 1989 began at

course. Firsts got $50,000, seconds $30,000 and thirds $20,000. Called
world-class, the race has the world's richest purse but includes no
drug testing.

San Diego stay away from this challenging and difficult race.

humidity.
