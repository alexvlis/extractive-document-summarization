Shining Path guerrillas, who started their bloody uprising in the
mountains of Peru and claimed to be defenders of impoverished Peruvian
coca farmers, are becoming a political force that seeks public support
in the makeshift communities near the capital where two-thirds of
Lima's 7 million people live. The rebels made a move into the
shantytowns that encircle the country's capital.

The Maoist followers of the movement, once secretive fanatics, made a
purposeful shift into a more public role that has coincided with
economic collapse and annual inflation of nearly 2,000 percent. From
their Andean base in the province of Ayacucho, the guerrillas demand
that farmers pay for protection from anti-drug police with one-fifth
of their coca crop.

They also banned drug abuse, prostitution, homosexuality and thievery
from the villages they control in Peru's Upper Huallaga River Valley.
Though a number of top Shining Path leaders were arrested by
authorities, the Shining Path Central Committee, made up of members
who remain free, decided to continue the "people's war."

The committee criticizes the leaders under arrest who try to convince
the militants still operating to end the hostilities against the
Peruvian government.  However, jailed leaders drew up their own peace
proposal agreement with the government. The 10-point agreement said
its main goal was to "stop the popular war with its four forms of
fighting: terrorism, selective murders, sabotage, and armed agitation
and propaganda."

The validity of that agreement was later challenged by Shining Path
members who had broken with the jailed insurgents.  In a statement
made during a television interview in Peru, subversion specialist
Carlos Tapia said he believed the Shining Path did not intend to seek
reconciliation in the country, had disarmed itself neither militarily
nor ideologically, and was instead trying to become a semi-legal
political party operating as a shock force against the opposition.

When Alberto Fujimori took over as Peru's president, there was
speculation as to whether the Shining Path guerrilla movement would
hound his administration as it had the previous two.  At the time of
Fujimori's inauguration, there was strong disagreement among Shining
Path watchers on a number of fundamental questions.  Was the Shining
Path getting stronger or weaker? Was it making progress or losing
ground among the population? And finally, who was actually winning the
war?</SUM>
