In 1989, it was reported that twelve million Americans had some form
of diabetes; over 150,000 died yearly from diabetes; another 150,000
died from diabetes-related illness.  Diabetes is a defect in the
body's system for using sugar in the blood.  It results from the
body's failure to make insulin.  The most common form of the disease
is Type II diabetes.  A study begun in 1988 indicated that the hormone
"amylin", found in the pancreases of diabetes, might be responsible
for reduced effectiveness of insulin observed in Type II diabetics.

Research in San Antonio, 50 percent Hispanic, has shown that poor
Hispanics are three times as likely to develop diabetes than the
general population; namely, because of their diet of cheap processed,
high-calorie foods, lack of exercise and infrequent medical attention.
Researchers there were testing an anti-diabetic drug, metaforim, used
successfully outside the US.  In San Jose and Santa Clara, California,
health officials, encouraged by Americans' success with lowering heart
disease, set up clinics and programs to educate Hispanics on the
dangers of diabetes and how to manage illness.  Students were given
instructions, geared to Hispanic lifestyle, on cooking with
polyunsaturated oil instead of lard and on the benefits of good
nutrition and exercise.</SUM>
