In 1989, it was reported that twelve million Americans have some form
of diabetes; more than 150,000 Americans died from diabetes each year;
another 150,000 deaths were diabetes related; and Hispanics were three
times as likely to develop diabetes than the general population.
Accordingly, diabetes afflicted one in eight Hispanic adults, a rate
higher than that of any ethnic group except American Indians.

Diabetes is a defect in the body's system for using sugar in the
blood.  It results from the body's failure to make insulin.  In 1988,
a study began of a newly isolated hormone, dubbed "amylin", found in
the pancreases of diabetics that was expected to lead to new
treatments for Type II diabetes, the most common form of the disease.
Amylin may be responsible for obesity, reduced insulin secretion, and
the reduced effectiveness of insulin observed in Type II diabetes.

Complications include kidney disease, blindness, and gangrene.
Researchers hoped to develop substances that block amylin's secretion.
Some researchers believed that Hispanics held the key to what sparks
diabetes.  San Antonio, 50 percent Hispanic in population, became a
base for diabetes studies.  The most common form was found to develop
mostly in obese adults over forty with a family history of the
disease.  Researchers felt that poor Hispanics' diet of cheap
processed, high-calorie foods, lack of exercise, and infrequent
medical attention increased their risk of acquiring diabetes.
Researchers started testing an anti-diabetic drug used successfully
outside the US, called metaforim, which was expected to have FDA
approval.  Moreover, there was confidence that Hispanics would respond
to educational efforts on the disease.

Examples of how educational programs could work were the indications
that Americans' risk of heart disease was lowering.  In San Jose,
California, a free hospital clinic and neighborhood programs were set
up for Hispanics to learn how to manage illness.  The focus was on
three ways to manage diabetes: diet, exercise and medication.
Participants would learn that traditional dishes could be just as
tasty, but healthier, when made with unsaturated fats and that
exercise could reduce weight, which in turn would lower the risk of
contacting diabetes.  Similarly, health professionals of a Santa Clara
Valley Hispanic Program began nutrition and exercise classes in an
effort to educate Hispanics on the dangers of diabetes.  Students
would be given instructions, geared to Hispanic lifestyle, on cooking
with polyunsaturated oil instead of lard and on the benefits of good
nutrition and exercise.</SUM>
