Clarence Thomas, a black conservative republican, was confirmed as a
justice of the U.S. Supreme Court on 16 October 1991.  He replaced
Thurgood Marshall who retired.  Prior to confirmation, journalists
wondered how much influence Thomas' wife, Virginia, might have on his
Supreme Court decisions.

Thomas was born into poverty in Pinpoint, Georgia, in 1948.  His
father deserted the family and his mother was forced to send her son
to the grandparents.  His grandfather was a taskmaster who taught him
hard work and self-reliance.

His grandparents scraped together enough money to send him to a local
catholic school.  Later, he entered a seminary but left disillusioned
when he discovered prejudice there.

Clarence Thomas worked his way through Holy Cross College in
Worcester, Massachusetts, earning a Bachelor's degree in 1971.  He
became a black activist.  He went on to Yale Law School, earning a
degree in law in 1974.  It was during law school that he became more
conservative in his political views.  He became a critic of
affirmative action and racial preferences for minority groups.

John Danforth, who later became a senator for Missouri, selected
Thomas as an assistant attorney general shortly after Thomas'
graduation from Yale in 1974.

In 1982 Thomas was appointed Chairman, Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission.  In 1990, President Bush selected Clarence Thomas to the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Complaints from liberals and senior citizens were ignored during the
confirmation hearings.

Thomas is a bootstrap conservative and a believer in personal strength
and individualism over government activism. Civil rights groups
opposed Thomas, saying that he was insensitive to the concerns of
minorities and the elderly.

In place of quotas and affirmative action, Thomas believed that one
should take advantage of the opportunities afforded by the U.S. Peggy
Noonan of the Wall Street Journal believed that Thomas "made it"
because he was loved by his mother, grandparents and the nuns who
taught him. Thomas, says Noonan, did not make it on his own but has
been helped all his life by affirmative action.

On 16 October 1991, when confirmation to the Supreme Court came for
Thomas, it brought joy and prayer to his mother and the townspeople of
Pinpoint, Georgia. When asked about the sexual harassment charge
brought against her son by Anita Hill in 1981- 83, his mother replied
with a prayer and a comment that "someone put her up to it."</SUM>
