Ben Johnson, who came to Toronto from Jamaica as a scrawny 14-year-old, at 26 won an 
Olympic gold medal for the 100-meter dash in a record-breaking 9.79 seconds in Seoul 
on September 24, 1988. He forfeited it when his after-race urine sample, mandatory for 
Olympic winners, proved positive for the illegal anabolic muscle-building steroid 
Stanozolol. He was also automatically suspended from international competition for two 
years and banned from Canada's national team for life. His Olympic world-record time 
was revoked. 

The gold medal went to American Carl Lewis, who suspected Johnson took drugs at the 
Olympics because he came out of the blocks like a caged lion after looking tired in 
qualifying heats. Johnson denied any drug use and was backed by his family, sister Clare 
Rodney and mother Gloria in Toronto and father Ben Johnson Sr. in Falmouth, Jamaica. 
Sports Minister Jean Charest heard rumors of Johnson's steroid use but tests were always 
negative.

Teammate Angella Issajenko said physician Dr. George (Jamie) Astaphan provided 
steroids to both her and Johnson with the knowledge of their coach Charlie Francis. 
Astaphan later said Johnson took a banned steroid once in May 1988 when he was 
depressed by a hamstring injury. Francis originally suggested sabotage of the sample by 
someone connected with opponent Carl Lewis, but in March 1989 testified Johnson had 
taken Furazabol, Stanozolol and the human growth hormone since 1981. He estimated 
steroids made Johnson faster by one meter. 

Johnson testified in June 1989 he had taken illegal performance-enhancing drugs for 
seven years and began speaking out against drug use by athletes. In September 1989 the 
IAAF adopted the Ben Johnson Rule, allowing it to decertify results if athletes were later 
shown to have used a banned substance before performances. Johnson's results from 
1983 to 1989 were erased, including his record 9.83 in the 100 meters at the 1987 World 
Championships in Rome, although his after-race test was negative.

In 1990 Johnson was training to regain his form. His upper body was less bulky and his 
face less puffy, but he still weighed 174 pounds and was bench-pressing 365. He returned 
to competition in The Hamilton Spectator Indoor Games on January 11, 1991, where he  
came in second. Coach Francis was replaced by Loren Seagrave. Close associates were 
Jamaican-born Toronto businessman Kameel Azan, attorney Ed Futerman, and agent 
Larry Heidebrecht. Johnson was receiving high appearance fees and giving interviews 
only for pay.</SUM>
