Cecil Rhodes, the British industrialist colonist, founded De Beers
Consolidated Mines LTD in 1988. Since 1929 the Oppenheimer family has
controlled the company, and has led it through some perilous times. De
Beers is a South African company that owns and operates diamond mines,
and acting through its London-based Central Selling Organization, the
CSO, markets its own diamonds and those produced in Namibia, Botswana,
Zimbabwe, Angola, Australia, Zaire and the Soviet Union. The CSO
employs a mix of persuasion and actions that are often viewed as
oppressive to insure that its share of the world's market stays at 80
percent. Ten times a year the CSO offers its cache at sales, called
"sights", to dealers from Antwerp, New York, Tel Aviv and Bombay. Each
dealer is offered a box containing diamonds ranging in value up to 25
million dollars. A dealer who refuses the box may never be invited
back.  DE Beers' selling cartel has survived, in part, because
diamonds are not essential. Diamonds of lesser quality are used in
industry, but substitutes are readily available. Only 15 percent of
the world's diamonds are of gem quality, and they are prized only for
their show value. The values of those vary in accordance with the
world's economic state. The United States is the largest market for
gem quality diamonds, and Japan is the second. A carat weighs 200
milligrams. In 1985, at the nadir of a slump, the price of a one-carat
D-Flawless diamond plunged to 8,500 dollars. By mid-1987 the price of
such a diamond had recovered to 14,000 dollars.
 
Between 1987 and 1994 De Beers faced some troubling situations. In
South Africa there was a threat that sources of the nation's wealth
would be nationalized. The dissolution of the Soviet Union created a
situation so sensitive that Mr. Oppenheimer was forced to visit Russia
and the mines in Siberia. In Botswana, the source of the worlds most
valuable diamonds, the government wanted to sell more of its diamonds
independently.  In 1989 the CSO faced a complaint of anti-competitive
practices filed in Great Britain. In 1992 an influx of illicitly mined
and marketed Angolan diamonds upset the supply-demand equilibrium. De
Beers plowed ahead. In 1992 they opened the first new South African
mine in 25 years, and professed confidence in the company's worldwide
position.</SUM>
