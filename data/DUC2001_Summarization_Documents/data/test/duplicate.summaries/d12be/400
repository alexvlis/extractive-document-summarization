The welfare situation in the U.S. was in such disarray and so costly
to the public during the Reagan and Clinton administrations that it
became a priority for reform.

The core of the problem concerned the several million families caught
up in poverty and dependency.  Huge sums (100 billion dollars per
annum) were given to welfare with no improvement.

During their administrations, the two presidents worked with the
governors to come up with solutions.  There was a surprising amount of
agreement.  One Reagan point of disagreement, however, was on a
minimum level of benefits.  He informed Congress at that time that he
would veto any legislation that did not contain a work requirement.

Democrats favored a House-passed bill that would make welfare
recipients who worked better off than those who did not work.  The
requirement to work would be left to the state and local governments
which administered the programs.

The House of Representatives during the Reagan administration was
scheduled to vote on another 5.2 billion dollar welfare bill.  It was
described as a welfare reform bill but in reality, it paid only lip
service to reform.  Both parties in the House believed that
welfare-to-work programs were valuable; however, the number of
long-term welfare recipients increased.  Reformers insisted that valid
reform shrink the number of welfare dependents and enhance the work
ethic.

The pledge to "end welfare as we know it" and the two-year limitation
on welfare checks were pre-election themes voiced by President
Clinton.  Amid public pressure to reduce the welfare rolls, Clinton's
reform efforts centered on expanded job training for the unemployed
and the requirement that people work for a welfare check.

In an attempt to get some plan into operation, the federal government
gave its approval to the states of Wisconsin and Georgia to implement
their pilot programs. The Wisconsin plan discontinued payments under
the program Aid To Families Of Dependent Children after two years.

The Georgia plan reduced welfare payments to all able-bodied adults
who refused to work and denied increases to families on long-term
welfare who have more children.

The U.S. was not the only nation faced with welfare reform.
Capitalist economies in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) were all faced with spiraling welfare costs.  One
view held that OECD nations at some future point might only be able to
afford caring for those unable to care for themselves.</SUM>
