During the late eighties and early nineties, welfare reforms were
crafted by Congress and Presidents Reagan and Clinton, while governors
were urged to submit their own welfare plans.

In 1987, President Reagan was reminded by the Wall Street Journal that
the public was exasperated by welfare costs and urged to make reforms
with work as the centerpiece.

The governors agreed that a job-support system should be adopted. The
drawback was the two billion dollar price tag.

In 1987 the Wall Street journal criticized the Family Welfare Reform
Act then in the House, saying that less than one-fourth of its cost
would be spent for welfare-to-work programs.

Later President Reagan threatened to veto any plan without a work
provision.  He asked the states to craft individual plans.

In 1993, President Clinton promised to reform welfare, including job
training and work requirements, health and child-care benefits.  He
asked states to experiment with welfare.

In August the Financial Times suggested that welfare was synonymous
with urban ills to Americans, and President Clinton was suggesting
subliminally that his welfare package would cure other urban problems.

Government conservatives suggested a strict time-limit for welfare,
while others urged a Roosevelt-like job program.

Internationally, other states were suffering from increased deficit
and debt from growing longevity and increased welfare, pension and
healthcare costs.</SUM>
