In October 1988 the British and French were tunneling 80-130 feet
under the English Channel. It was the beginning of the "Chunnel",
intended to connect Folkstone, England with Calais, France. It was
scheduled for completion in 1993-94.

Britain was a reluctant partner in building the tunnel, unlike
France. Britain bemoaned the loss of its island status and pondered
the possibility of importing "Continental ills." Britain also did not
want the environmental pollution of a high speed train that would
improve the transit of people and goods.

France, on the other hand, was eager to improve the poor economy of
northern France and to build a high speed train on their side.

The tunnel was the center of Europe's attention. It would
revolutionize the economy of northern Europe. The project, however,
was running into cost overruns.

Finally, on 30 October 1990, the connection between Britain and France
was made by a 2-inch probe.

The economic promise of the tunnel was expected to cause a real estate
recovery on both sides of the Channel. Property was at bargain prices.

The Belgians as well as the French expected an economic boost from the
tunnel for the depressed West Flanders and Hainaut areas.</SUM>
