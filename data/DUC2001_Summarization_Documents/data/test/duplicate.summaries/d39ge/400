By October 1988, the British and the French were tunneling, with two
huge boring machines, 80-130 feet under the English Channel.  This was
the first of three tunnels to connect Folkstone, England and Calais,
France. This service tunnel was to be followed by the building of two
train tunnels.  "The Chunnel", as it was collectively called, was
scheduled for completion in 1993-94.

Although moving ahead with the construction of the "Chunnel', Britain,
unlike France, did not intend to fund a high speed train (TGV) link to
connect with the "Chunnel."  Those against a TGV link believed the
real money would be in freight handling by truck from London to the
tunnel; some did not want the environmental hazards of high speed
rail. Those in favor of a TGV link believed that Britain would be left
on the fringe of an economic boom without it.

The whole project dwarfed all other construction efforts in
Europe. Estimates were that it would revolutionize northern Europe's
economy. The train trip from London to Paris would take about three
hours. No profit was expected before the year 2000.

Progress on the "Chunnel" by 1990 was proceeding almost on
schedule. Twenty- seven miles of the service tunnel were
completed. There was a number of cost overruns and when the project
was completed, it would cost up to 17.5 billion dollars.

On 30 October 1990, Britain and France were linked together via a
2-inch probe beneath the English Channel. It was the realization of a
dream for several centuries.

Public attitudes of the British and French were interesting. The
British believed the tunnel would do nothing but import "Continental
Ills." In short, they bemoaned the loss of their island status.
  
The French, on the other hand, looked forward to a new prosperity for
depressed northern France. They eagerly began construction of a high
speed rail hook-up with the tunnel at Calais.

The economic promise of the tunnel was expected to cause a real estate
recovery on both sides of the Chunnel when it opened on 6 May
1994. Property prices were low and bargains were available.

The French were not alone in expecting an economic boost from the
Chunnel. Belgian officials also saw economic improvements for the
depressed West Flanders and Hainaut areas. Although Belgium's ports
would suffer some decline in sea traffic with the opening of the
Chunnel, there were already signs of increasing economic activity in
West Flanders.</SUM>
