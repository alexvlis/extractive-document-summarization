Researchers believe spongiform encephalopathy (SE) diseases are caused
by an abnormal protein (prion), which, after a long incubation period,
eats holes in the brain.  The first SE disease (scrapies) has attacked
British sheep since the 1700's.  In 1986 "mad cow disease" was
diagnosed in cattle that had eaten feed containing sheep by-products.
By 1994 more than 120,00 cattle and a few other animals--including
cats and African antelope--had died in the UK from "mad cow."  Since
tainted feed was banned years ago, researchers continued to search for
other transmission methods.  Two SE diseases, Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (CJD) and Gerstmann Straussler syndrome, rarely afflict man,
but researchers are looking for connections, especially a feared
causal relationship, with "mad cow disease."

By 1990, beef consumption had dropped drastically in the UK and the
U.S. and six other countries banned import of British cattle and their
embryos and semen.  By 1994, after the deaths of two British dairy
farmers to CJD (a statistical improbability) and "mad cow disease"
deaths in European cattle, Germany proposed a ban on importing live
cattle or beef from Britain.  European Union health ministers were to
discuss the ban, but the UK, fighting to save the British beef
industry, maintained operative restrictions were adequate.</SUM>
