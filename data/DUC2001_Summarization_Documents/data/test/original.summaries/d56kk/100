Twelve million Americans have diabetes, but minorities are hardest
hit, with 14- 21% of Hispanics and up to 40% of minority seniors
suffering the disease, many undiagnosed.

San Antonio, Texas, has become a research center for the condition,
focusing on genetic research, patient identification and education
among the public.  Researchers at U. Texas believe that poor dietary
and exercise habits and inadequate medical care are root causes.

A similar effort is underway in California to educate the public about
the symptoms, treatment and complications of diabetes.

Researchers report progress on genetic and hormonal aspects of the
disease.</SUM>
