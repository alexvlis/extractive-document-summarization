Twelve million Americans have diabetes, but minorities are hardest
hit.  14-21% of Hispanics and up to 40% of minority seniors may become
victims, usually of Type II Adult onset diabetes.

Texas and California, with high Hispanic populations, are especially
vulnerable.  In San Antonio, (40% Hispanic) a research center operates
at the University of Texas Health Center, focusing on finding a gene
that may lead to a screening test.  They also send teams out to the
local neighborhoods to test for diabetes and educate the population.
Researchers believe that poor Hispanics' diet of fried foods, lack of
exercise and infrequent medical attention are the root causes of their
predisposition.

California, with its high Hispanic population, is also active in the
struggle, led by the Diabetes Society.  They focus on prevention of
obesity; teaching clients healthy diet and exercise habits, and the
symptoms, treatment and complications of diabetes.  They have learned
that cultural tendencies are highly important factors in this work.

Meanwhile, researchers are working to find new treatments and tests
for diabetes.  One hope is the discovery of amylin, a hormone found
only in diabetics' pancreases.

Symptoms include increased hunger, thirst and urination, with weight
loss.</SUM>
