Twelve million Americans have diabetes, but the incidence is highest
in minorities - Native Americans, Hispanics and blacks.  Hispanics are
three times more likely to develop diabetes as the general population;
that is, 14-21% of Hispanics, and up to 40% of those in the 64 to 75
year age range may develop the disease.  Adult Onset, or Type II
diabetes, is the most common type found in this group.

This is especially devastating in those parts of the country that are
heavily populated with these ethnic groups.  San Antonio, Texas, where
the population is 50% Hispanic, often of Mexican origin, the
University of Texas Health Center has become a center of diabetes
investigation, attracting a prestigious group of investigators from
Yale University to relocate there.  Their hope is to locate a gene
predisposing to the disease, and develop a screening test for
potential victims.

Dr. Ralph DeFronzo, who heads the group, has sent teams out to the
neighborhoods to study the local population, test for the disease, and
teach methods of control and prevention.  His researchers believe that
poor Hispanics' diet, frequently dominated by cheap processed and
fried foods, their lack of exercise and infrequent medical attention
are the root causes of their predisposition.  They are also reaching
out to educate children, a step they believe is critical.

California, with its high Latino population, is also active in the
struggle, led by health professionals and the Diabetes Society.  Their
program focuses on prevention of obesity, a key predisposing factor,
along with strong heredity tendencies.  Clients are taught to modify
their diet, especially food preparation - frying with unsaturated
fats, for example, spacing of meals throughout the day and increasing
exercise.  The Society also teaches about symptoms, treatment and
complications of diabetes.  They are learning that cultural factors
are highly important in combating the disease.

Meanwhile, researchers have reported to the International Diabetes
Foundation that they have found a hormone which may lead to new
treatments for Type II diabetes.  Amylin, found in high levels in the
diabetic pancreas, may be responsible for the obesity and lower
insulin secretion and effectiveness found in these patients.
Currently, obesity is thought of as a cause, not an effect, of the
disease.  Researchers hope to learn how to block amylin's actions.

Symptoms of diabetes include excessive urination, thirst and hunger
with an accompanying weight loss.  Complications include kidney
disease, blindness, and gangrene of the extremities.</SUM>
