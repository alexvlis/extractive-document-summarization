Interpretation of the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
concerning the right to keep and bear arms becomes critical when
considering legislation on the control of firearms.

The National Rifle Association (NRA) leads a vocal pro-gun lobby.  It
is a powerful organization with considerable resources. The NRA
interprets the Second Amendment as guaranteeing the right of each
individual to bear arms. This organization does not want restrictions
placed on the sale of guns and does not believe that gun control
measures are a hindrance to crime. Through its lobbying efforts, it
has been successful on numerous occasions in getting proposed gun
control bills rejected.

Gun control advocates interpret the Second Amendment in the light of
its 1792 context, that is, it is not a blanket endorsement for gun
ownership.

They also do not believe that there is any provision in the Second
Amendment that would preclude the registration of firearms.

Public opinion polls, perhaps fueled by rising crime statistics,
appear to be turning toward a more favorable view of the need for gun
control legislation. Some polls show that even gun owners are more in
favor of some type of controls.</SUM>
