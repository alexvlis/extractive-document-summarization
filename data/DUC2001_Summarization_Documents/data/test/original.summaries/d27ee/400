The Second Amendment to the Constitution reads: "A well regulated
militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of
the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."  The Supreme
Court has, on several occasions, interpreted this amendment as
limiting the powers of the federal government and not guaranteeing the
right of individuals to bear arms.

Interpretation of the Second Amendment becomes critical when it is
used by pro- and anti-gun control advocates.

Leading the gun lobby charge is the National Rifle Association
(NRA). It is an organization of considerable resources and lobbying
power.

The cornerstone of its existence is the strict interpretation of the
Second Amendment as guaranteeing the right of each individual to bear
arms.

Some of the views of the NRA and the gun lobby include:

        a. Gun control measures are not effective and do not reduce crime. 

        b. Gun availability to the public is a deterrent to crime. 

        c. The issue is not gun control but rather the breakdown of
           social institutions.

Gun lobbyists were buoyed by the decision of a Maine judge in 1989.
Maine's constitution previously guaranteed the right to keep and bear
arms "for the common defense." In 1987, a change was made deleting
this phrase. The amendment then read in part that every citizen could
keep and bear arms. With this change, even felons could bear arms.

Gun control advocates interpret the Second Amendment in its 1792
context, that is, it is not a blanket endorsement for gun
ownership. They argue that the Second Amendment provides a basis for
gun control legislation.  Licensing and registration, they say, would
be similar to the procedures we use for other freedoms.

It is perhaps ironic that the gun control movement in the
U.S. sprouted from Roger B. Taney, the racist chief justice of the
U.S. and author of the Dred Scott Decision of 1857. His decision was
carried over into the context of the Second Amendment due to the
racial paranoia about black men with guns.  This paranoia resulted in
restrictions being placed on gun ownership.

There appears to be some light on the horizon for gun proponents. Some
polls show that gun control measures are favored even by gun owners.
Congress has passed the Brady Bill and banned assault weapons. Perhaps
measures like these will begin to solve some of our violence problems
with firearms.</SUM>
