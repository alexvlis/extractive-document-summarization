Fire is a natural part of Western forest and rangeland.  However, some
years are worse than others.  Drought conditions, high winds, and a
tremendous build-up of tinder helped make the 1988 fires the worst in
a hundred years.  Nearly 1.5 million acres burned in the greater
Yellowstone ecosystem, including 705,000 acres within the National
Park.  Residents of the northeastern corner of the Park were
threatened to be burned out.  Eventually, millions of dollars,
thousands of man-hours, and an early autumn snowfall saved the area.
The Forest and National Park Services spent a combined $300 million
fighting the fires.

The House Agriculture Committee has planned hearings for next year
into how the US Forest Service handled the wildfires, focusing on
fire-fighting policies, area rehabilitation, and scientific research
on the fires.  Arguments rage on the impact of fires on wildlife, the
conduct of officials responsible for monitoring the blazes, and the
role of the media in giving the impression that a national treasure
had burned to cinders.  The Interior Department, in response, has
ordered a moratorium on its potentially sensitive "let-burn" policy.
The 1989 fire season also started to gear up with firefighters in five
Western states battling hundreds of blazes, most started by lightning.

Strategists and quartermasters at the Boise Interagency Fire Center in
Idaho direct the nation's wildfire battles.  Specialists marshal
resources from around the nation and track the fires.  New studies
show the men and women who battle wildfires face an unseen hazard from
the smoke--effects from poisonous gasses and soot, acceleration of
aging, heart attacks, and respiratory diseases.  Overly heavy gear and
inadequate filters are also a problem.

Because of a five-year drought and rains that nurture grass now
turning dry, California geared up for a dangerous wildfire season in
1991.  Firefighters were most concerned about rural areas.  Residents
have been advised to take special precautions; notably, clearing a
30-foot defensible space of dry grass and brush from around the house.
In Santa Barbara, California, the idea of firescaping--fire-resistant
landscaping--has been introduced.  Xeriscaping--landscaping with local
drought tolerant plants--is becoming commonplace.  Officials in the
San Francisco Bay area have identified local areas that have community
problems with the greatest potential for a firestorm; namely, a
preponderance of wood homes and a mix of dense homes and dry forest.
Firefighters complain overall that moving into wooded seclusion and
natural beauty exacts a cost in fire protection.</SUM>
