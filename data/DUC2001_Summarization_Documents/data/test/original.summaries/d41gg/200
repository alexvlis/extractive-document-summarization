Fire is a natural part of western forest and rangeland.  However, some
years are worse than others are.  The 1988 fires were the worst in a
hundred years.  Nearly 1.5 million acres burned in the greater
Yellowstone ecosystem.  The Forest and National Park Services spent a
combined $300 million fighting the fires.

The House Agriculture Committee planned hearing for 1989-1990 into how
the U.S. Forest Service handled the wildfire, focusing on
fire-fighting policies, area rehabilitation and scientific research on
the fires.  The Interior Department soon ordered a moratorium on its
potentially sensitive "let-burn" policy.  The 1989 fire season geared
up with firefighters in five Western states battling hundreds of
blazes.  The nation's wildfire battles are directed by specialists at
the Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho.  New studies show unseen
smoke hazards by firefighters: effects from poisonous gasses and soot,
heart attacks, and respiratory diseases.

California was geared up for a dangerous wildfire season in 1991.
Residents have been advised to clear away a 30-foot space from around
the house.  Fire-resistant landscaping ideas have been introduced in
Santa Barbara, and around San Francisco Bay, officials identified
local areas having community problems with the greatest potential for
a firestorm.</SUM>
