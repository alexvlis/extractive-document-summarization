The year 1988 had the highest earthquake death toll in 12 years.  The
Armenian quake, with 25,000 deaths, brought the toll to the highest
since 1976.  In that year, a Chinese quake killed 250,000 people.
Other 1988 quakes killed 2,000 persons.  The U.S. Geological Survey
reported 61 significant quakes in 1988, including events in Asia,
North America, Europe and Africa.

Also in 1988, the Geological Survey predicted that the bay area in
California was likely to have an earthquake, based on the time elapsed
since the 1906 quake.  On Tuesday, a 6.9 earthquake occurred in the
Santa Cruz area, fulfilling that prediction and causing widespread
damage, especially to highways and old masonry buildings.
	
Another earthquake-prone area is Guadacanal Island in the Solomons
which experienced an earthquake at 8:05 p.m. on October 28, 1989,
measuring 7.2 on the Richter.  There were no injuries or damage.  No
tsunami was reported.  This was the strongest quake reported in the
world in the last five months.

The Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on the
seismograph.  Each increase of one whole number means a tenfold
increase in magnitude.

Chile is the world's most seismic country, with a coastline of 2,270
miles along the "ring of fire," between the Nacza and American plates.
In 1985, a 7.1 tremblor occurred, comparable to the San Francisco
quake, and a 9.5 quake destroyed the city of Valparaiso in 1960.  In
that event, part of the coastline dropped nine feet, killing 5,000,
and was followed by a tsunami.

Iben Browning, a climatologist, has predicted a major earthquake along
the 120 mile New Madrid fault in Tennessee in December 1990, based on
his study of tidal forces. This area experienced a series of quakes in
1811 and 1812, probably measuring higher than 8 on the then
non-existent Richter scale.  Some residents plan to leave town; others
are attending earthquake survival classes, while some businesses and
schools plan to close.

Waverly Person of the Geological Survey, does not support the New
Madrid prediction, stating that although earthquakes can be tracked
historically, forecasting them is difficult if not impossible.

Japan, however, one of the world's most earthquake-prone areas,
supports an early-warning center, monitored constantly to report any
unusual seismic activity in the Tokai area.  Plans have been made to
evacuate residents, reroute traffic and close schools and businesses
if experts feel a quake is imminent.  This effort costs 2.5 million
dollars a year.</SUM>
