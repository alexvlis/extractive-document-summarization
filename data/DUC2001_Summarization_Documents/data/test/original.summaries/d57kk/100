The world suffered 27,000 deaths in 1988, in 61 significant
earthquakes, including an Armenian quake killing 25,000. On October
17, 1989, Santa Cruz, California experienced a damaging, 6.9 quake.
Later that month, Guadacanal Island experienced a tremblor of 7.2
intensity, the strongest in five months.

The world's most seismic country is Chile, whose coastline of 2270
miles is on the "ring of fire."

In the midwestern U.S. a scientist forecasted a quake on the New
Madrid fault for December of 1990. The Geologic Survey disagrees,
citing unreliability of such predictions.  Japan, however, supports an
early warning center.</SUM>
