The year 1988 had the highest earthquake toll in 12 years. The
Armenian quake killed 25,000 people, while others killed 2,000 more.
The U.S.  Geological Survey reported 61 significant quakes worldwide
in 1988.

In 1988 that agency also predicted that the bay area in California was
likely to have an earthquake, based on time elapsed since the 1906
occurrence.  On Oct.  17, 1989, Santa Cruz experienced a 6.9 tremblor,
causing widespread damage.

On the 28th of that month Guadacanal Island in the Solomons
experienced a quake measuring 7.2 on the Richter.  No injuries or
damage were reported, but this was the strongest reported in five
months.

The world's most seismic country is Chile, with a coastline of 2,270
miles along the "ring of fire."  In 1985 a 7.1 tremblor occurred, and
in 1960 a 9.5 earthquake destroyed the city of Valparaiso.

In the United States, Iben Browning has predicted an eruption of the
New Madrid, Tennessee fault, which experienced major earthquakes in
1811 and 1812. The U.S. Geological Survey disagrees, saying that
forecasting earthquakes is difficult if not impossible.

Japan, however, supports an early warning center at a cost of 2.5
million dollars annually.</SUM>
