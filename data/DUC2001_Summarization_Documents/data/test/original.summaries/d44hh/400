Approval of the North American free trade agreement between the US,
Canada and Mexico, once thought assured, faced strong opposition from
labor, grassroots groups, and the presidential campaign of billionaire
Ross Perot. For three years, groups working on a shoestring budget
argued that NAFTA would send US jobs to Mexico and undermine two
decades of environmental protection work. They financed an office for
"anti-NAFTA czar" former Indiana congressman Jim Jontz.

The Hispanic community was divided. Hispanic business organizations
enthusiastically backed NAFTA but civil rights groups feared the
Hispanic American working class would bear most of NAFTA's negative
impact. Sectors of the US economy most vulnerable to import
penetration were those most dependent on recent immigration for their
labor. Key US Hispanic groups made environment and worker rights
agreements a condition of their support.

The business community widely supported NAFTA and spent millions to
win over Congress. Investors believed passage of NAFTA would be good
for the economy, reasoning that superior US industrial productivity
and products would benefit in a more open trading environment. NAFTA
rejection would lead to more protectionism, higher inflation and
slower world economic growth. House Speaker Tom Foley said much of
what people feared would happen more quickly without NAFTA than with
it.

President Clinton insisted global marketplace realities must be faced
but supported NAFTA only after environmental and labor-issue side
agreements were reached. As the November 17, 1993 House vote
approached, he chose William Daley, with his Washington and
organized-labor connections, to build NAFTA support in Congress. The
undecided were summoned to the White House where Clinton was said to
buy them off with promises of new projects in their
districts. Clinton's support for a North American Development Bank to
assist NAFTA-damaged communities was expected. Former Presidents
Carter, Bush and Ford spoke in NAFTA's support.

Economic sluggishness and corporate layoff announcements helped raise
anti-NAFTA sentiment to its highest level in September 1993, but after
a November debate victory by Vice President Gore over Ross Perot,
NAFTA support rose from 34% to 57%. Four days before the vote the
outcome was still too close to call.

After NAFTA's approval, Central American and Caribbean governments
fearing a more competitive Mexico awaited word on Clinton's promised
Caribbean-basin market protections. Parity on some exports was
expected but leaders feared it would come at the high price of
investment treaties, intellectual property and workers' rights
agreements, environmental legislation, democracy and
accountability.</SUM>
