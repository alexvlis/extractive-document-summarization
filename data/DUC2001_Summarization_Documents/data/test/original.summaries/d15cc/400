Tuberculosis is a highly communicable disease caused by bacteria
transmitted through the air when infected people sneeze or cough.  The
morbidity rate of the disease was on a decline from the 1950s until
the late 1970s or early 1980s. Public health officials and health
organizations recognized that the rate of decline had slowed, and by
the mid-1980s it was increasing at an alarming rate. By 1990 the World
Health Organization, a United Nations Agency, said that tuberculosis
was the world's deadliest infectious disease, killing three million a
year.

The incidence of tuberculosis varied from region to region, from
country to country, and in the United States, from state to
state. Tuberculosis was running rampant in Sub- Saharan Africa, an
area where in earlier times it had not been a problem. It was also
increasing in Latin America and Southeast Asia. Even in Latvia, where
it might seem out of place, the morbidity rose by 14 percent from 1992
to 1993. The figures for 1989 illustrate how the occurrence of
tuberculosis varied in the United States. There was a five percent
overall increase for the nation. No new cases were reported in
Wyoming, but New Jersey had a 35 percent increase in reported cases.

The connection between AIDS and tuberculosis was the single most
important factor in turning tuberculosis from a declining disease to
one of epidemic proportions. This was true in the poorer areas of the
world, and especially in Africa. It is estimated that from one-seventh
to one-tenth of the world's population carry the tuberculosis
bacterium. They can carry it for a lifetime without becoming ill. When
body defenses are weakened, as they are with AIDS, the latent bacteria
might mutate into full-blown tuberculosis.  Besides being at risk
themselves, the AIDS patients with tuberculosis transmit it to others.

Researchers have found that prisoners are three times more likely to
have tuberculosis than those on the outside. Modern airtight buildings
with ventilators that circulate stale air are sources of
tuberculosis. Socioeconomic conditions have always been perceived as
the reason that blacks in the United States are six times more likely
than whites to contract tuberculosis. An extensive study concluded
that blacks are genetically more at risk, and all conditions being
equal, blacks would still be twice as likely as whites to have the
disease.</SUM>
