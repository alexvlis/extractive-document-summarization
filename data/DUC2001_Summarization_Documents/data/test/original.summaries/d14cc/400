A review of data concerning crashes of United States military aircraft
that occurred between June 1998 and October 1990 reveals that the
subject crashes took place in many parts of the world and under widely
varying circumstances.  The list of accidents is by no means complete,
but it is representative.  Accidents befell aircraft of the United
States Air Force, the Navy and the Marines.  A huge transport, a
bomber that has been the backbone of the force, attack jets,
air-to-air fighters, a training plane and helicopters suffered
accidents during the period.  Aircraft accidents occurred over oceans,
aboard a carrier, in the United States, Britain, Japan, Germany and
Saudi Arabia.

The United States was at peace throughout the period, and no accident
was the result of enemy action.  However, by the end of the period,
after August 1990 there were accidents during Operation Desert Shield
when the United States was building up its forces in the Persian Gulf.

The greatest loss of life in a single accident on August 29, 1990 when
a C-5 transport crashed near Ramstein in West Germany, killing 13 of
the 17 aboard the plane.  Nine of the 13 dead were reservists who had
volunteered for Operation Desert Shield.  The crash that caused the
most serious backlash also occurred in Germany when a United States
A-10 attack plane killed seven Germans while cutting a swath of
destruction through a populated area.  This crash followed upon
earlier crashes of NATO aircraft caused German protests, and prompted
German officials to worry publicly about an adverse affect on defense
issues.
     
A concise listing of the crashes not specifically mentioned above
follows.  In 1988 two Air Force F-16s collided in air south of Mainz
in Germany, and a single F-16 crashed in Northern Japan, and two Navy
F-14 fighters crashed in the United States, and an Air Force B-52
bomber crashed in Michigan, and finally, an A-10 Thunderbolt went down
in Britain.  In 1989 the only aircraft accident reported was that
involving a Navy trainer on the carrier Lexington.  In October 1990 an
Air Force F-111, an Air Force F-4 reconnaissance jet, an Air Force
F-15E, and two Marine UH-1 helicopters went down.  Those heavy losses
caused the Pentagon to suspend training for 24 hours.</SUM>
