Aircraft crashes between June 1988 and October 1990 destroyed planes
of the United States Air Force, Navy and Marines.  Individual crashes
occurred on three continents, over oceans and on an aircraft carrier.
No accident was caused by enemy action, but several occurred when
activity was at a high level in preparation for combat.  Attack
aircraft, fighters, helicopters, a bomber, a transport, and a trainer
were lost.  Some accidents claimed no lives; one caused 13 deaths.
Some aircraft fell in isolated areas; one tore through a heavily
populated area.</SUM>
