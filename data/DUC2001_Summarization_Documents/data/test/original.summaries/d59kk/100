A survey of some of the plane crashes between 1987 and 1991 reveals a
number of probable causes, although some remain unknown.

In 1987, an airliner crashed on takeoff in Detroit when an engine
failed, killing 154, while a British jet crashed on landing after one
engine caught fire and the pilot shut down the other in error. A
United DC-10 experienced total hydraulic failure after an engine
exploded, causing a crash landing.
	  	
Two planes exploded due to terrorist bombings, while three crashed in
bad weather.  One crashed into a mountain; another, into woods.

All are under investigation.</SUM>
