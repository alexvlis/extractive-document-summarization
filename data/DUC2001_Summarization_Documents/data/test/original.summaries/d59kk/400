Following is a random survey of some of the plane crashes that
occurred from 1987 to 1991.

1. A Northwest Airlines MD-82 crashed on takeoff August 16, 1987 in
Detroit.  Engine failure was a likely cause and 154 people died; one
child survived.

2. On May 7, 1988, a single-engine Cessna crashed in the outskirts of
Albuquerque, New Mexico in rain and wind, killing four adults and one
child.  The pilot aborted the first landing attempt and crashed while
making a second try.

3. On a flight from London to Belfast, a Boeing 737 crash-landed at
East Midlands Airport.  It appeared that the left engine had caught
fire but the pilot shut down the right engine in error.  The resulting
crash killed 49 people and injured 82, including the pilot.

4. Pan American flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland and
crashed on December 22, 1988, killing all 259 aboard and 22 others on
the ground. Warnings of a terrorist plot to bomb a Pan Am flight had
been received prior to the incident.

5.  On July 20, 1989, a United Airlines pilot tried valiantly to bring
a DC-10 airliner under control after a rare complete hydraulic
failure.  The cause may have been an engine explosion in which debris
damaged a duct common to all three hydraulic systems.  The plane
crash-landed into a cornfield in Iowa.  Casualties included 127 killed
but 166 survived as the plane broke apart, then exploded and burned.
Some passengers walked away unharmed.

6.  On August 14, 1989, a twin engine Otter disappeared in Ethiopia.
After a six day search, wreckage was located on a mountain peak.  All
16 aboard perished, including Representative Mickey Leland of Texas
and other government officials, who were touring refugee camps in
Africa.

7.  A French UTA DC-10 jetliner crashed into the desert of Niger,
Northern Africa, killing all 171 aboard, including the wife of the
American Ambassador to Chad.  The plane exploded in midair; a
terrorist plot is suspected.

8.  On March 4, 1991, a United Airlines 737 crashed into a dry lake
near the Colorado Springs, Colorado, airport.  Twenty passengers and a
crew of five were killed when the plane nose-dived to earth, probably
due to wind shear.

9. A single engine Cessna plowed into some woods in Mississippi on
August 14, 1989, carrying the pilot and his passenger, Rep. Larkin
Smith, to their death.  No cause has been determined.</SUM>
