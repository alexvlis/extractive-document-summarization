During the period 1989-1992 many cases of "police brutality" or
excessive use of force by police officers were reported, some
supported by videotapes and many of which went to trial. Many of the
cases had racist overtones with white officers attacking black or
Hispanic victims. By far the most notorious such case took place in
Los Angeles, California on March 3,1991 when four officers took turns
beating Rodney G. King as 17 other officers stood by watching. Caught
on videotape, this incident received nationwide attention and resulted
in a series of recommendations from a special commission headed by
Warren Christopher, including resignation of Police Chief Daryl Gates,
major reorganization of the Los Angeles police department, and
introduction of community policing. Acquittal of the four policemen
the following year resulted in massive rioting and, finally, the
resignation of Chief Gates.

Los Angeles was not the only venue for charges of police brutality. In
1989 minority groups in Minneapolis, usually regarded as a liberal
progressive city, asked for an outside review of the police department
after a series of incidents. The local Urban League president said,
"The matter of police misconduct and brutality has been going on for
at least the 21 years I've been here."  In Chicago the City Council
held hearings on police brutality against blacks who accused
officers--most of them white--of unprovoked beatings, false arrests,
intimidation, and insulting them with racial slurs. In 1990 Kansas
City, MO experienced seven shooting deaths involving police as well as
several cases of white officers using excessive force against blacks,
including two clergymen.

Complaints of police brutality were not limited to black victims
accusing white officers. Anti-abortion demonstrators associated with
Operation Rescue charged police in more than 50 cities with use of
excessive force, intentionally hurting non-violent demonstrators while
arresting them. Police, to counter the demonstrators' tactic of "going
limp," used techniques such as pressing fingers under the victims'
noses, digging knuckles into their necks, and torquing martial arts
weapons around their wrists. Police termed these techniques "pain-
compliance" but the demonstrators called it torture and said serious
injuries had resulted at the hands of police in Denver, Atlanta,
Pittsburgh, San Diego, West Hartford, Conn., and Boston. In response
to complaints from Operation Rescue, congress passed and on November
15, 1989 President Bush signed legislation withholding certain federal
grants from cities whose police used excessive force.</SUM>
