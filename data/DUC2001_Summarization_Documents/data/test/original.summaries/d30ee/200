The programs of the World Bank have yet to meet with success in
reducing the Third World debt.

There are a number of ideas on how this should be accomplished.  One
is to invest in the private sector and bypass the governments of
developing countries.  Another is to lend new money only and not
reduce any debt.  Yet another is to write-off Third World debt as
uncollectible.

A persistent problem in the loaning of money by the World Bank to
Third World governments is that they are often swamped by interest
payments.  Brazil, the largest debtor nation, blames the
industrialized countries for its poverty problems.

It is difficult to obtain a definitive statement from officials of the
World Bank. Specific targets and goals toward the alleviation of
poverty and the crushing debt are avoided.  Some believe that the
bank's policies are correct and that poverty in the Third World is
caused by their own governments.

Recent individual efforts to alleviate Third World poverty and debt
may be successful.  "Village banking" is a means of investment using
loans to poor women at low interest rates to finance their private
enterprise.  Similar arrangements are being made by third world banks
and development organizations.</SUM>
