Despite changes in its leadership and a revamping of its policies, the
World Bank has yet to reduce the burgeoning Third World debt, one of
its stated goals.

There are a number of views on how this should be accomplished.  One
view is to by-pass the governments of developing countries and invest
directly in the private sector.  Another view is to follow
conservative fiscal policies of lending new money and not to reduce
any debt.  Some bank managers want to see political strings attached
to World Bank loans.

One problem that persists in the lending of funds to the Third World
by the World Bank: the loan of new money often results in swamping the
receiving countries with interest payments.  The total received by the
World Bank sometimes amounts to more than it lends in loans.  Brazil,
the heaviest debtor nation, blames the industrial nations for the
poverty of developing nations.

As if in answer to Brazil's problems, the Bank of Boston has begun a
policy of writing-off its loans to the third world as uncollectible.
This policy however, may inhibit any new loans to the Third World.

Lord Bauer of the House of Lords, British Parliament, voiced his
objection to a recent "Letter to the Editor" of the Wall Street
Journal.  He defended the efforts of the World Bank to alleviate debt
in the Third World.  Bauer emphasized that the loans do not increase
with inflation and are often canceled or rescheduled.  Bauer also
believes that Africa's poverty is domestically-caused by some Third
World governments' policies.

A new concept in getting funds to the poor is that developed by John
Hatch.  His idea, called "village banking," is a means of investment
using small loans to poor women at low interest to finance their own
private enterprise.  The village banking idea has grown in nine
countries and the loans are nearly 100 percent repaid.

Third World banks and large development organizations are now
participating in "microloans."  It is a guarantee for repayment
because the recipients want to earn a favorable credit rating.  The
plus factor is that it eliminates loan sharks.

The World Bank may be getting more on track according to a recent
statement by its president.  The bank will reward any Third World
government with larger loans for a stronger commitment on poverty
reduction.  Conversely, he stated that a weaker commitment to poverty
reduction will warrant less support.</SUM>
