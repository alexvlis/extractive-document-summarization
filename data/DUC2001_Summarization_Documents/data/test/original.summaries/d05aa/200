After the appearance of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or
"madcow disease" in Britain in 1986 the British government tried to
contain the epidemic but the number of cases increased over the next
eight years. More than 120,000 cattle were lost. Other countries
placed embargoes on cattle from Britain and by 1994 Germany was
threatening to ban any importation of British beef.

BSE is similar to a common ovine malady (scrapie) and, more
importantly, to another form of spongiform encephalopathy that occurs
rarely among humans: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). All three of
these forms are invariably fatal.  The cause is an abnormal form of
protein in the brain, prion, that converts protein into its abnormal
form. The mode of transmission of CJD is unknown.  Publicized cases of
CJD appearing among sheep herders and dairy farmers led many to
believe that perhaps humans catch the disease from cattle with BSE or
from sheep with scrapie or from eating beef or lamb. Most scientists
say there is no evidence to support this belief, but it has gained
wide currency and will probably persist until research gives a better
explanation. In 1994 the German government announced a far-reaching
program to study whether BSE can be transmitted to humans.</SUM>
