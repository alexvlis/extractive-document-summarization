"Mad cow disease" or bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE) was first
diagnosed in 1986 after an outbreak in Britain. It is similar to a
sheep disease known as scrapie which has been known in Britain since
the 1700's. The disease eats holes in the brains of its victims and is
impossible to detect early on because it does not cause the immune
system to produce antibodies. Research into the cause and means of
transmission of BSE has been intertwined with study of two human forms
of spongiform encephalopathy: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and
kuru. All forms of the malady are infectious, invariably fatal, and
may go undetected for years as brain cells are eaten away until a
critical mass is spongified. Then over a few months the victim loses
motor control and dies quickly, usually within a year. The cause of
the disease is an abnormal form of protein, prion, that converts
normal protein into its own abnormal form. The means of transmission
of CJD is unknown. Cattle feed containing offal of infected sheep is a
suspect in the case of BSE but the disease has continued to spread
long after a ban on such feed was effected in Britain in 1988.

By April 1990 10,000 cattle had been destroyed in Britain after being
diagnosed with BSE and the British government budgeted $16 million for
compensation in its efforts to control the disease. By March 1994 more
than 120,000 cattle had been diagnosed with BSE. Germany called for a
complete ban on imports of British beef and the scientific journal
Nature proposed replacing the entire British cattle population with
disease-free herds at a cost of 30 billion pounds.

Much of the public uproar over BSE stemmed from fear that humans could
catch CJD from cattle or from eating beef. As early as 1975 there was
a curiously high incidence of CJD in a sheep-herding area of Slovakia
where scrapie was present. After the outbreak of BSE in Britain two
dairy farmers contracted CJD.  Most scientists insisted that these
were coincidences but in March 1994 the German government announced a
program involving seven universities and research institutes to study
whether BSE can be transmitted to human beings. Professor Hans
Kretzschmar of Gottingen stated, "The danger that BSE can be
transmitted to humans is minimal or non-existent; however, we do not
know that it is non-existent. I personally think (British beef) should
not be imported."</SUM>
