In the early 1990's there was a strong move to enact term limitations
on elected officials, especially legislators.  Several states were
voting on limitations and some factions wanted national action
restricting Congressional terms.  Polls revealed 75% of all Americans
backed term limits.

Those supporting term limitations believed too much power had moved to
the legislative branch from the executive branch.  Political careerism
was decried.  The inability to unseat an incumbent was blamed on
franking privileges and campaign finance laws.  With term limits, some
expected candidates to become more dependent on the party for
financial assistance and less dependent on special interest groups.
Term limitations were portrayed as constitutional.

Opponents of term limits believed they were illogical, wrong, an
insult to voters and not supported by the nation's founders.  More
inexperienced legislators would only increase the power of special
interest groups, the unelected Congressional staffers, and Executive
branch bureaucrats.  Terms limits would throw the good performers out
with the bad.

The term limit opponents who agreed that the public was growing
dissatisfied with the electoral process suggested an end to some of
the legislative perquisites and overhauls of the committee and
seniority systems.</SUM>
