In the early 1990's there was a strong move to enact term limitations
on elected officials, especially legislators.  Several states were
voting on limitations and some factions wanted national action
restricting Congressional terms.  Polls revealed 75% of all Americans
backed term limits.  Citizens appeared dissatisfied with so few
changes in the Congress--96% of incumbents were re-elected during the
previous three elections and one in four incumbents had no major party
opposition.

Two positions on the issue were expressed by politicians, academics,
and journalists.  Those supporting term limitations believed too much
power had moved to the legislative branch from the executive branch,
which was subjected to limitations.  Political careerism was decried.
Some viewed being in Washington as corrupting people's common sense,
while "productive citizens" were not willing to commit more than 6
years to living in Washington.  The inability to unseat an incumbent
was blamed on franking privileges and campaign finance laws.  With
term limits, some expected candidates to become more dependent on the
party for financial assistance and less dependent on special interest
groups.  Term limitations were portrayed as constitutional since they
did not restrict the right to vote for a candidate because of ideology
and did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.
The Supreme Court has long reserved to the states the regulation of
elections.  While many Democrats believed term-limit supporters were
conservatives, some past Democratic leaders were cited as supporting
the idea.

Opponents of term limits believed they were illogical, wrong and an
insult to voters.  More inexperienced legislators would only increase
the power of special interest groups, the unelected Congressional
staffers, and Executive branch bureaucrats.  More amateurs would be
more vulnerable to corruption.  Legislators would automatically become
lame ducks and would be more interested in their next job than their
current one.  Terms limits assume the voters don't know what they are
doing and would throw the good performers out with the bad. While some
proponents apparently believed the founding fathers supported limits,
Hamilton and Madison both wrote against them.  With term limits some
of the vital legislation of the past might not have been enacted.

The term limit opponents who agreed that the public was growing
dissatisfied with the electoral process suggested other solutions.
Some recommended an end to some of the legislative perquisites and
others suggested Congress could become more responsive with overhauls
of the committee and seniority systems.</SUM>
