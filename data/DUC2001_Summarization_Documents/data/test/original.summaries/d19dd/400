Forty members of the House of Representatives along with the
Federation for American Immigration Reform will take part in a lawsuit
that will be filed in the U.S.  District Court in Pittsburgh.  The
groups will sue the Census Bureau in an effort to force the agency to
delete illegal aliens from the 1990 count.

Traditionally, the Census Bureau counts everyone living in the
country.  The groups, which have filed suit to ignore the illegal
aliens, believe that large concentrations of them could result in some
states gaining seats in the House of Representatives at the expense of
other states.

Opposing groups want the final census totals to be increased to
account for people who may be overlooked.  These include Blacks and
Hispanics living in urban areas.

There is a 435-seat limit in Congress.  Therefore, when one state
gains a house member another must loose one.

The Constitution was amended after the Civil War to say that the
apportionment of House seats will be based on "the whole number of
persons in each state."  The amendment does not mention citizenship in
connection with apportionment.

Lawmaker clashed while debating whether following the letter of the
Constitution results in a system that is unfair to citizens. The
Census Bureau contends that the effort to determine who is an illegal
alien could delay and complicate the count and in effect invalidate
it.

Identifying illegal aliens for the count may be a difficult thing to
do.  Generally speaking a person who is in the country illegally does
not want to be spotted by the government.  And then there is the
question of who should be counted as a person and who, if anybody
should not.

Public officials in California condemned a Senate vote to exclude
illegal aliens from the 1990 census.  The general feeling is that the
Senate's action will shortchange California in Congress.  California
stands to loose millions of dollars in federal aid for the poor.

In the past, about $80 million has been paid out annually for
emergency medical services for California's illegal aliens.

"Every census since the Constitution was created has counted all
residents of the states, both citizens and non-citizens" observed
Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif.

Rep. Thomas Petri, R-Wis. on the other hand said, "It is wrong to
apportion Congressional seats by counting people who would be deported
if our immigration laws were enforced."

The Senate, with its' vote to exclude illegal aliens from the census
count has opened the door for the Supreme Court to make the final
decision.</SUM>
