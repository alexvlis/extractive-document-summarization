In late August 1992 Hurricane Andrew hit the Florida coast south of
Miami with winds up to 165 mph, causing at least fifteen deaths,
severe property damage and leaving 1.2 million homes without
electricity. In Dade County alone 250,000 were left homeless. The town
of Homestead and its nearby air force base were leveled. As the storm
continued across the Gulf of Mexico it was feared that it might hit
New Orleans, but fortunately it made landfall in a relatively lightly
populated area of Louisiana and quickly lost force as it moved over
land.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency which was charged with
handling such disasters had become a Republican patronage reserve and
proved completely incapable of doing its job. After frustrating delays
in providing any effective relief, two of President Bush's assistants,
Transportation Secretary Andrew Card and Chief of Staff James Baker,
stepped in to do the job. The president dispatched troops to Florida
and gave a nationwide television address from the Oval Office
promising to rebuild Homestead Air Force Base and committing the
government to paying relief costs. The insurance costs of Andrew alone
were about $8 billion making it the most expensive disaster to have
hit the US up to that time.</SUM>
