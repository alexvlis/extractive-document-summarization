Hurricane Andrew which hit the Florida coast south of Miami in late
August 1992 was at the time the most expensive disaster in US
history. Andrew's damage in Florida cost the insurance industry about
$8 billion. There were fifteen deaths, severe property damage, 1.2
million homes were left without electricity, and in Dade county alone
250,000 were left homeless. Early efforts at relief were marked by
wrangling between state and federal officials and frustrating delays,
but the White House soon stepped in, dispatching troops to the area
and committing the federal government to rebuilding and funding an
effective relief effort.</SUM>
