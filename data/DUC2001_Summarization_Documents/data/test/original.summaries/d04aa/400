In late August 1992 Hurricane Andrew moved from the Bahamas across
southern Florida and across the Gulf of Mexico into Louisiana. As the
hurricane hit the east coast of Florida south of Miami with winds
gusting up to 165 mph, it ripped off roofs, smashed cars and trucks,
snapped power lines, and uprooted trees.  There were at least fifteen
deaths, severe property damage, and 1.2 million homes were left
without electricity.  The storm destroyed the homes of one- eighth of
the residents of Dade County leaving approximately 250,000 homeless.
The town of Homestead and its nearby Air Force Base were leveled. As
the storm continued across the Gulf of Mexico there was concern that
it might hit New Orleans. New Orleans, with a population of 1.6
million, is particularly susceptible to flooding since it lies below
sea level, is intersected by the Mississippi River and has a large
lake immediately to its north. Officials in Louisiana, Mississippi,
and Texas urged more than two million people to evacuate coastal
areas. Fortunately the hurricane missed New Orleans and made landfall
in a relatively lightly populated area. As it moved inland Andrew
quickly lost force so that it was soon downgraded to tropical storm
with winds at less than 75 mph.

Local officials in Florida were critical of a delay in supplying food,
drinking water and other supplies for thousands of people in need. The
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) set up by President Carter
in 1979 to handle disasters such as Andrew had become, under
Republican administrations, the ultimate patronage backwater, having
ten times as many political appointees as a typical agency. FEMA was
caught completely unprepared by Andrew. There were unseemly disputes
between state and federal authorities over who should do what in
bringing relief. Finally two of the President's right-hand men,
Transportation Secretary Andrew Card and Chief of Staff James Baker,
stepped in to do what FEMA should have done. Bush ordered military
forces to Florida to organize and run the relief effort and gave a
televised speech to the nation from the Oval Office promising to
rebuild Homestead Air Force Base and committing the government to
paying the emergency relief costs. Estimates of the cost of Hurricane
Andrew vary but the insurance costs alone came to about $8 billion
making it clearly the most expensive disaster ever to have hit the US
up to that time.</SUM>
