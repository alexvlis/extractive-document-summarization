On 1 December 1990, British and French workers digging the 31-mile
tunnel or "chunnel" between Dover, England and the coast of France
since 1988, finally met after knocking out a passage large enough to
walk through.  Construction was expected to be completed by May 1994.
It has reinforced historic trading links, enabled freight to travel on
a single track instead of being transferred to trucks for a ferry
trip, and cut the London-Paris journey from six hours to three.

Some wondered initially whether Britain would be ready for it.  Polls
showed that the English did not want a fixed link, were afraid of
rabies, rats and terrorists crawling through.  In SE England, the
rural English were reluctant to have high-speed trains screaming
through their backyards.

The chunnel was viewed positively in France where it was hoped that
the project would revitalize depressed northern regions where the
tunnel surfaced.  Areas for development were the property market in
northeastern France as buyer and entrepreneurs set up a base on the
Continent; increasing traffic as holidaymakers and freight carriers
headed for the tunnel; and tourism.  On the negative side, the
tunnel's completion could aggravate traffic congestion in a wide area
of continental Europe.</SUM>
