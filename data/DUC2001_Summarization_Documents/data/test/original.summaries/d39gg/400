Construction of a 31-mile tunnel, 24 miles of it under water, underway
since 1988 between Dover, England and the coast of France, was
expected to be completed by May 1994.  The "chunnel" was a symbol of
European unity.  It reinforced historically dominant trading links
(London - Frankfurt - Milan), cut the London-Paris journey from six
hours to three hours, and enabled freight to travel on a single train
instead of being transferred to trucks for a ferry trip.

Some wondered initially whether Britain was ready for it.  Nationwide
opinion polls about the chunnel showed that the English did not want a
fixed link; liked ferries and their island story; were afraid of long,
dark tunnels underwater and rabies, not to mention European
undesirables.  In addition, critics said that obsolete commuter lines
in SE England would cause delays and the rural English were reluctant
to have high-speed trains screaming through their backyards.
Moreover, in June 1990, the British government refused to fund a
high-speed rail link between London and the tunnel, telling the
consortium formed to build the link that the contribution would
involve "unacceptable" risks to the taxpayers.  The construction was
almost 60% over budget with contractors embroiled in a dispute over
$1.7 in overruns and scrambling for more investment money.

The tunnel was viewed positively in France because it surfaced in one
of their most depressed areas, hence the French were forging ahead
with a high-speed rail link.  France hoped the project would
revitalize the depressed northern regions.  The chunnel was to be a
starting point for recovery in the property market in northeastern
France.  Prospective buyers included hauliers who wanted to set up a
base on the Continent and Asian entrepreneurs who saw advantage in
being close to Belgium.  Main areas for development were increasing
traffic as holidaymakers and freight carriers headed for the tunnel
opening in Calais, and tourism throughout the attractive, open green
spaces.  On the negative side, a study released in Paris said the
tunnel's completion would aggravate traffic congestion in a wide area
of continental Europe.  In addition, Belgium's biggest ports would
suffer a loss in traffic.

In October 1990, the first land link between Britain and France was
created when British workers sent a two-inch wide probe through to
their French colleagues.  On 1 December 1990, British and French
workers digging the tunnel finally met after knocking out a passage
large enough to walk through.</SUM>
