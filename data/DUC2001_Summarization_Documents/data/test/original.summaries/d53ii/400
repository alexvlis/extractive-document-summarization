The Shining Path is a Maoist splinter group of the Peruvian Communist
Party and was founded in 1970 by Abimael Guzman, a Marxist philosophy
professor.  This group sought to overthrow Peru's elected government
and install a peasant and worker state.  It first concentrated on
semi-clandestine political work with peasants in the Andean highlands,
gaining support from Indians long persecuted by the ruling elite, who
are ethnic Europeans.  In 1980, the group took up arms and began
guerrilla operations.  In the mid-1980's, the guerrillas began to move
into the jungles of the Upper Huallaga Valley.  There, they gained
support among the coca farmers.  Although they demanded one-fifth of
the farmer's crop, the Shining Path guerrillas provided protection
from the abuses and corruption of the police and anti-drug operations.
Having a reputation for almost puritanical honesty, they brought their
own brand of law and order to the region, killing those who disobeyed.
By 1988, the government claimed the fighting had taken 15,000 lives
and caused $10 million in property damage.

In mid-1987, the guerrillas began taking a more public role in the
shantytowns surrounding Lima.  They became involved with labor unions
and student groups and published at newspaper "El Diario."  By 1990,
according to Peru's President Garcia, the People's Defense
Revolutionary Movement had been formed to operate in Lima and other
coastal urban areas.  Violence occurred in Lima preceding the July 28,
1990 presidential run-off election between Mario Vargas Llosa and
Alberto Fujimori.  Peruvian presidents had not been successful in
handling the Shining Path.  Belaunde had ignored the guerrillas.
Garcia had first tried a liberal approach, then a get-tough approach,
then hoped simply to coexist.  While Fujimori had campaigned
advocating economic-development initiatives, his actual policies were
quite different.

By 1994, many leaders of the group, including Guzman, were in jail.  A
faction of free guerrillas led by Alberto Ramirez Durand, aka
"Feliciano," had formed and was beginning to assert power.  According
to a Peruvian subversion specialist, the government hoped to
strengthen Guzman's position, allowing him to organize a second party
congress from jail, which would recommend disarmament and the end of
violence.  A 10-point agreement that would stop the fighting,
dismantle the guerrilla army, allow exiled members to return, and
permit a gradual general amnesty was rumored to exist.  In February
1994, the Shining Path Central Committee, presided over by Feliciano
and comprised of leaders who had not been arrested, repudiated any
peace overtures and their advocates.  The committee called for
continuation of the people's war, even in the cities.</SUM>
