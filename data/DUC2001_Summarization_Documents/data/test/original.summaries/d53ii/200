The Shining Path is a Maoist splinter group of the Peruvian Communist
Party and was founded in 1970 by Abimael Guzman.  This group sought to
overthrow Peru's elected government and install a peasant and worker
state.  It first worked with peasants in the Andean highlands, gaining
support from long-persecuted Indians.  The group began guerrilla
operations in 1980 and, by the mid-1980's, began to move into the
jungles, providing protection for coca growers.  By 1988, the
government claimed the fighting had taken 15,000 lives and caused $10
million in property damage.  Involvement in urban areas began in 1987.
Until Fujimori was elected president in 1990, Peruvian presidents had
not been successful in handling the Shining Path, but by 1994, many
leaders of the group, including Guzman, were in jail.  A faction of
free guerrillas led by Alberto Ramirez Durand, aka "Feliciano," had
formed and was beginning to assert power.  According to a Peruvian
subversion specialist, the government hoped to strengthen Guzman's
position, allowing him to organize a second party congress from jail,
which would recommend disarmament and end of violence.  In February
1994, the Feliciano faction repudiated all peace efforts and called
for continuation of the people's war.</SUM>
