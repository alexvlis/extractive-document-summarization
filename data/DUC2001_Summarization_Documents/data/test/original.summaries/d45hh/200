In March 1988 economic decline increased friction between liberal,
rich Slovenia and hardline communist Serbia. After Slovenia arrested
pro-Serbian demonstrators in December 1989, Serbia severed political
and economic contact. In June 1990 a new government in Slovenia
approved a plan for Slovenian sovereignty within a Yugoslav
confederation. Croatia took similar action.

Fighting erupted after Serbian president Milosevic delayed the 1991
installation of a Croatian federal president and both Slovenia and
federal forces prepared for further hostilities. In mid-June an
EC-brokered cease-fire called for installation of the president and a
three-month delay in independence moves. More fighting followed
Slovenia's and Croatia's June 25, 1991 secession from Yugoslavia.

Problems facing Slovenia's efforts to become a market-oriented
democracy included funds still frozen by Yugoslavia in March 1992 and
the need to establish new foreign credit and gain admission to the IMF
and World Bank. By May 1992 inflation was under control. Slovenia
sought new markets to replace those lost in Yugoslavia. By March 1993
privatization had begun, wages had dropped and productivity rose as
Slovenia worked to stay competitive without cheap Serbian raw
materials.

In February 1994 Slovenia approached Belgrade regarding normalization
of relations, but Serbia insisted Slovenia end its anti-Serbian
campaign first.</SUM>
