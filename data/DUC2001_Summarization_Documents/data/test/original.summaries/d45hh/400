Economic decline caused increasing friction between liberal, rich
Slovenia, the source of most of Yugoslavia's wealth, and hardline
communist Serbia, as Slovenia watched the bloated, Serbian-dominated
bureaucracy erode its finances. Serbia vehemently opposed independence
moves by Slovenia and Croatia, fearing loss of economic support. In
March 1988 federal military commanders planned to arrest Slovenian
journalists and officials and crush subsequent protest
demonstrations. The plan was blocked after being reported by Slovenian
security. In December 1989 Slovenia banned a pro-Serbian rally in
Lubljana and arrested 13 demonstrators, prompting Serbia to sever
political and economic contact.

In June 1990 a Slovenian center-right coalition government, which had
defeated reform communists, approved a plan for Slovenian sovereignty
within a Yugoslav confederation.  It planned a democratic constitution
and threatened to declare full independence if remaining republics did
not agree to the confederation. Croatia took similar action, prompted
by recent Serbian crackdowns in Kosovo.

Fighting in Slovenia killed 40 after Serbian president Milosevic
delayed the 1991 installation of a Croatian federal president. Both
sides prepared for further hostilities.  In mid-June an EC-brokered
cease-fire called for installation of the president and a three- month
delay in moves toward independence.

On June 25, 1991 Slovenia and Croatia seceded from Yugoslavia.  In
subsequent fighting, recently-formed Slovenian militia were outmatched
by federal ground and air forces. Following secession, EC countries
hesitated to recognize Slovenian independence for fear of encouraging
their own minorities, but Slovenia was determined to become a
market-oriented, multi-party, parliamentary democracy.

In March 1992 Slovenian foreign exchange deposits still remained
frozen by the National Bank of Yugoslavia. Slovenia worked to
establish new foreign credit and be recognized by the US in order to
help improve its economic prospects and speed admission to the IMF and
World Bank. By May 1992 Slovenian unemployment rose as industrial
production dropped, but a strong monetary policy kept inflation under
control. Slovenia signed trade agreements with Croatia and Macedonia,
sought new markets among EC countries to replace the large Yugoslav
market it had lost, and considered privatization.  By March 1993 wages
had dropped and productivity rose as Slovenia worked to stay
competitive without cheap Serbian raw materials. Privatization and
market reform had begun.

In February 1994 Slovenia made overtures to Belgrade regarding
normalization of relations in an effort to adapt its policy to that of
the European Union, which it wanted to join. Serbia expressed interest
but remained resentful, saying first Slovenia needed to end its
anti-Serbian campaign.</SUM>
