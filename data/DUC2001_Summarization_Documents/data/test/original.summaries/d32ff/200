Exxon Valdez, a tanker loaded with Alaskan Crude, struck a reef in
Prince William Sound on March 24, 1989, and became the largest oil
spill in US history.  Over 11M gallons of crude spilled from the
tanker.  Initial clean-up efforts were inadequate.  An unqualified
third mate was piloting the vessel when it ran aground; the captain,
Joseph Hazelwood, was not on the bridge and was found to have been
drunk.  He was later arrested in New York, and a year later, tried in
Alaska and convicted of negligence but acquitted of more serious
charges.

The oil spill expanded to an area the size of Delaware.  Exxon's
clean-up plans were deemed inadequate by Alaskan Governor Cowper and
the US Coast Guard which was better qualified to lead the effort.
Thousands of birds and sea animals were killed by the spilled oil.
Exxon maintained that no species were wiped out and that populations
would rebuild.  The US Fish and Wildlife Service said that might take
70 years.  Many recommendations of Governor Cowper were enacted, but a
year later were still inadequate to deal with another oil spill of 10M
gallons.  Exxon estimated its 1989 clean up costs at $2B and could
increase from that amount.</SUM>
