Exxon Valdez, a tanker loaded at Valdez, Alaska, with crude oil from
the Trans-Alaskan pipeline struck a reef in Prince William Sound on 24
March 1989, and became the largest oil spill in US history.  Over 11M
gallons of crude were dumped into the pristine waterway.  Clean up
efforts were delayed by insufficient equipment and lack of agreement
on plans. The Valdez was illegally piloted by its third mate, who did
not have a proper license.  It had struck one rock pinnacle a mile out
of the shipping lane then continued on for two miles and ran aground
on Bligh Reef, 25 miles from the city of Valdez.  The ship's captain,
Joseph Hazelwood, was not on the bridge at the time of the accident
and was determined to have been drunk.  Hazelwood left Alaska after
the accident for Long Island, New York, where he later surrendered to
police and was released on $25,000 bail (reduced from $500,00).  He
was tried a year later in Alaska and found guilty of negligent
discharge of oil but innocent of more serious charges.

Oil remaining in the Valdez was eventually pumped into other tankers
and the Valdez refloated and sent for repair.  Alaska's Governor and
the US Coast Guard were highly critical of Exxon plans for, and
efforts in, the clean up and the latter organization was deemed more
qualified to lead the effort.  The oil slick from the spill expanded
to cover an area the size of Delaware.  Thousands of birds and aquatic
animals were killed by the oil and even brown bears were threatened.
Exxon maintained that no species were wiped-out and populations could
be rebuilt.  But the US Fish and Wildlife Service said that could take
as long as 70 years.

Although many recommendations were made by Alaskan Governor Cowper and
some put into place, but a year later plans and supplies were still
inadequate to cope with a 10M gallon spill.  Clean up spending
eventually compensated for some lost revenues, but that area of
Alaska, dependent on fishing, oil, and tourism lost money in those
categories.

Exxon estimated its 1989 costs for the clean up as $2B and could rise
another $500,000.  Those costs cut into Exxon profits but analysts
said that the size of the company would insulate it from serious
long-term financial damage.  Exxon's reputation did suffer from the
Valdez and another spill of heating oil in waters between New Jersey
and New York and a one day "Boycot Exxon" campaign.</SUM>
