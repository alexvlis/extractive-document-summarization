De Beers Consolidated Mines of South Africa controls 80% of the
world's uncut diamond market through its London-based Central Selling
Organization. The cartel has sales agreements with mines and offers
diamonds to select dealers. De Beers was formed in 1888 by Cecil
Rhodes and has been controlled since 1929 by the Oppenheimer family.
De Beers has kept the diamond market stable by controlling supply. It
has bought up diamonds that flooded the market, discouraged banks from
lending to diamond speculators, dumped diamonds to force producers
into sales agreements, imposed quotas on producers when sales were
declining, and revived the industry by putting big money into
promotion.

De Beers has maintained its own production by opening a new mine and
extending the life of two others through underground mining.
Innovations have included automated processing and bussing workers in
daily from their homes.

Desire for greater control of their countries' wealth has caused
African nations to demand better terms. In 1990 De Beers moved half
its interests to Switzerland.

After the breakup of the Soviet Union, unofficial diamond exports were
rumored and De Beers signed a new sales agreement with the republic of
Yukutia.

The US remains the largest diamond market, followed by Japan.</SUM>
