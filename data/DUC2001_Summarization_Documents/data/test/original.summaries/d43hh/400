De Beers Consolidated Mines of South Africa is the sole middleman in a
diamond cartel known as the Syndicate, which controls 80% of the
world's uncut diamond market.  The cartel is a pipeline between mines
in various countries and international diamond cutting centers.  Its
London-based Central Selling Organization offers diamond assortments
at 10 "sights" a year to a select group of 160 dealers. De Beers was
formed in 1888 by British colonialist Cecil Rhodes and has been
controlled since 1929 by South Africa's Oppenheimer family. Its rise
began in 1938 when Harry Oppenheimer began urging couples to buy
diamond engagement rings.

A brief 1989 investigation of De Beers' alleged anti-competitive
practices was dropped, but De Beers has aggressively, ruthlessly and
effectively kept the diamond market stable by controlling supply.
When recession in the early 1980s forced diamond speculators to dump
diamonds, De Beers educated banks to discourage them from lending to
diamond speculators.  When Zaire left the cartel in 1981 De Beer
dumped diamonds to force it back in. In the late 1980s, it revived the
industry by putting millions of dollars into promotion, withholding
stocks, and imposing large price increases. When illegal mining began
in Angola, De Beers bought up smuggled-out diamonds. It imposed quotas
on producers in 1994 after sales declined because of slowing
economies, high interest rates and a market flooded with illegal
diamonds.

De Beers has maintained its own production, although its 100-year old
Kimberley mines began running out, by opening the Venetia mine in 1992
and by planning to extend the life of its Finsch mine and the Jwaneng
mine, co-owned with Botswana, through underground mining whenever
open-pit maximum productive depth was reached.  Recent mining
innovations have included reducing employees through automated
processing and fewer overseers, and replacing migrant workers with
those bussed in from their homes for daily shifts.

Desire for greater control over their wealth eventually caused several
black majority African nations to demand a share of ownership or
negotiate the right to partially sell independently. To limit risk, in
1990 De Beers moved half its interests to Switzerland.  After the
breakup of the Soviet Union, De Beers signed a new sales agreement
with the autonomous republic of Yukutia, where most Soviet diamonds
are mined, although the former USSR's reorganization of its diamond
industry remained unsettled. Unofficial Russian diamond exports have
long been rumored. The US remains the largest diamond market, followed
by Japan.</SUM>
