Clarence Thomas was born in a rural area of Georgia on June 23,
1948. His father deserted the family when Clarence was seven years
old, and he was taken in by his maternal grandparents. He has
frequently said that his grandfather had an overpowering effect on his
development, and credit for any success that he had achieved was owed
to his hard-working grandparents. Each year they scraped together to
keep him in a Catholic school where they hoped the nuns would instill
values and discipline.  His grandparents taught him perseverance, the
value of hard work, and the need to rely on himself to succeed in a
hostile environment.

Thomas graduated from Holy Cross College in 1971. He participated in
campus protests and championed liberal causes while in college. He
still held these views when he entered Yale Law School. But by the
time he graduated in 1974, he had renounced them as contrary to all
that had been ingrained in him by his grandparents.

John Danforth, then Attorney for Missouri, recruited Thomas to serve
as an assistant.  Thomas was an attorney for the Monsanto Company from
1977 to 1979. Danforth, by then a senator, employed him as a
legislative assistant until 1981. With the coming of the Reagan
administration, Thomas was made Assistant Secretary of Education for
Civil Rights, and a year later he became the Chairman of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission.  It was in this position that his
opposition to quotas and affirmative action drew attention and
criticism from liberals.

A black conservative, Thomas was a favorite of republicans. In 1990
President Bush appointed him to a judgeship on the United States
Circuit Court. The Senate confirmed him in a voice vote, but the
outspoken opposition to his appointment was a harbinger of the
struggle to come when Bush later named him to succeed Thurgood
Marshall on the Supreme Court. Supporters called him a man of humble
beginnings who rose to prominence on his own. Critics said that he was
helped along by government aid that he would now deny to
others. Senate confirmation in October 1991 made him an Associate
Supreme Court Judge.

Thomas is married to Virginia Thomas and has a son by an earlier
marriage.</SUM>
