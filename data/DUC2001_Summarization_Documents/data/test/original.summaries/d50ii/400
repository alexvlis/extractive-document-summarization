In 1988, a drought swept across the continental United States.  In
some areas of the Midwest, it was the driest April through June since
1895.  Thirteen states were involved by June and 29% of the nation was
affected by July.  Nationally the drought was about equal to the one
in 1911 and somewhat less severe than the one in 1956 and several
during the 1930's.

The U.S. Agriculture Department established a task force in March and
began a series of actions to assist farmers throughout the disaster
areas.  Special procedures implemented included allowing the use of
special conservation lands for animal feed production, special
purchases of meat for government feeding programs, and increased
exports of meat products.  Other areas of concern were limiting the
export of grains, potential loan defaults by farmers, drops in sales
of farm machinery, a drop in land sales, and an increase in food
prices.

In August 1988, President Reagan signed a $3.9 billion drought relief
bill.  This relief package was intended to save Midwestern grain
growers.  An Agriculture Department survey at that time predicted
grain production would be 31% smaller than 1987, with corn declining
34%, soybeans 23%, and wheat 13%.  The aid package did reduce loses
and stave off bankruptcies in the drought ravaged states of North
Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin.  But, according to a
1989 study conducted by the Associated Press, this election year
package provided money to one-quarter of all American farmers,
including some who had good harvests, collected crop insurance, or
were able to plant a second crop.  Because of loose regulations and
lax enforcement, some money also went to banks, corporations, churches
and local governments.

A 1990 postmortem of the drought revealed that it was not as bad as it
could have been.  Although net farm incomes in drought areas decreased
by almost $10,000, farms in all areas continued to improve their
solvency position and the number of financially vulnerable farms
continued to decrease.  Farmers survived by selling-off inventories
and taking advantage of higher market prices.

Late 1988 research and computer modeling, suggested that the drought
was caused by changes in the weather pattern created by ocean
temperature abnormalities near the equator in the Pacific Ocean.  In
April-June 1988, the abnormal temperature bands may have caused
alternating high and low pressure centers across the northern Western
Hemisphere preventing the normal flow of weather systems.</SUM>
