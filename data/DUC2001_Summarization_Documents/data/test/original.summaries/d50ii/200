In 1988, at least 29% of the nation was hit by a drought.  Nationally
the drought was about equal to the one in 1911.

Procedures were implemented to increase animal feed and sales of meat.
Other areas of concern were exporting grains, loan defaults, sales of
farm machinery, land sales and rising food prices.  In August 1988,
Reagan signed a $3.9 billion drought relief bill.  An Agriculture
Department survey had predicted that grain production would be 31%
smaller than 1987.  The aid package did reduce loses and stave off
bankruptcies in the drought ravaged states.  But, according to the
Associated Press, this election year package provided money to
one-quarter of all American farmers, even those who didn't need it,
and some banks, corporations, churches and local governments.

A 1990 postmortem of the drought revealed that it was not as bad as it
could have been.  Although net farm incomes in drought areas
decreased, the number of financially vulnerable farms also continued
to decrease.

Late 1988 research and computer modeling, suggested that the drought
was caused by changes in the weather pattern created by ocean
temperature abnormalities near the equator in the Pacific Ocean.</SUM>
