President Reagan, believing that Americans have become increasingly
exasperated by the enormous amount of money the government spends each
year on unsuccessful anti- poverty programs, made welfare reform a
priority for his administration.  He further believed that, given
America's strong economy with low unemployment, any welfare reform
program must contain a work requirement.  He vowed to veto any reform
legislation that Congress passed that did not contain a work
requirement, saying, "The best way to learn to work is to work."

A national consensus has been forming around welfare reform.
Fundamentally its goal should be: to shrink the welfare system, to
eliminate perverse incentives to remain on welfare, and to make work
the focus of welfare reform.  Controversy occurs when legislators
strive to determine how this goal should be accomplished.  Some
conservatives believe that a strict time limit, say, two years, should
be placed on the receipt of welfare.  Many people believe this is too
drastic, preferring a phased in program whereby welfare recipients
must do something to earn continued benefits, such as work, vocational
training or continuing education.  Many states began experimental
reform programs, some containing time limits, work or educational
requirements.

Bill Clinton also campaigned on a platform of welfare reform pledging
to "end welfare as we know it."  He, too, believes that welfare must
be temporary help to the needy and not a way of life.  However, upon
entering office, Clinton made it clear that welfare reform would have
to come after two higher priority items: reducing the deficit and
passing healthcare reform, both of which he believes would help
alleviate welfare.  The Family Support Act of 1988 is a welfare bill
that later became the focus of President Clinton's reform efforts.
This law is based on work done by the National Governors Association
while co-chaired by Clinton, then Governor of Arkansas.  The Clinton
administration was also flexible in granting individual states waivers
from federal welfare requirements in order to experiment with various
reform programs.  Several states had done so, quite successfully.

Welfare reform is not just an American problem.  The 24 member nations
of the European "Organization for Economic Co-operation" have
concluded that their rapidly growing welfare costs my soon become
insupportable.  Demographics, specifically an increasingly aged
population, is causing a significant increase in public pensions, the
OEC's largest welfare cost item.  In a competitive global economy, no
country can burden its businesses with higher welfare costs than its
neighbors.</SUM>
