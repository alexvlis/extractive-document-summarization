The world of marathon running is full of stories of success, failure
and excitement. The Boston Marathon has been the scene of a number of
these stories. John Kelley is an 83-year-old icon of this race and he
is about to enter his 60th marathon.

In the past, this marathon has turned into a speed duel and a race of
attrition.  The upcoming event will probably not be any different.

A number of years ago, Ethiopians surprised the world by winning
several prestigious marathons. That domination appears to be happening
again with Abebe Mekonnen, an Ethiopian policeman, winning the Boston
Marathon.

Patience is a desired asset for marathoners. Patience paid off for two
winners of the Chicago Marathon on Sunday. Heat, humidity, and strong
winds, however, sapped the strength of the runners. The two winners of
the men's and women's divisions conserved their energy until the last
few miles of the race.
	
Patience again paid off on Sunday for the running of the 26.2-mile
Long Beach Marathon. The two winners waited for other runners to make
mistakes and for the sun to take its toll.
	
As in other marathons in the U.S., foreigners dominated in the running
of the New York City Marathon. Douglas Wakiihuri a Kenyan, won
easily. The women's winner was Wanda Panfil from Poland.

Alphonce Swai is an example of a marathon runner who has tasted
victory and fallen in defeat. He is a recovering alcoholic. He lost
badly in the Coronado Hall Marathon but has won two races since that
event.

Ernesto Beatriz Martinez is a marathon runner of exceptional stamina.
He made his way on a 12-1/2 hour bus ride from his home in Mexico City
to the San Diego International Marathon. He arrived just in time for
the start of the race and won it in an amazing feat of endurance.

Lieutenant Zanti, USN, is a marathoner with determination. When he had
to cancel his plans to enter the Marine Corps Marathon in Washington,
he decided that he would run a marathon on his ship, the
WISCONSIN. The ship is 887 feet long and he will do 75 laps to equal
26.2 miles.

Finally, for the marathon enthusiast, there are now "marathon
vacations" for those runners who would like to run in a marathon and
see a city at the same time. Entry fees, registration, etc., are all
included in the tour package.</SUM>
