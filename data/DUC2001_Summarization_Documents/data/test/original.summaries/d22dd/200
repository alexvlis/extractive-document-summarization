In 1988 and 1989 forest fires burned out of control throughout the
United States.

One of the largest fires charred more than 2.1 million acres in
Alaska. Another three blazes burned more than 208,000 acres in
Montana.  Others states hit hard by forest fires included California,
Utah, Wyoming, Nebraska, Oregon, Washington, Michigan, Kentucky,
Idaho, Arizona, Georgia and New Mexico.

Many of the fires were started as a result of lightening. Fireworks
set off in celebration of Independence Day caused others.  Humans
started other fires, some by accident and some intentionally.

Following the 1988-forest fire season, a panel studying the
government's "let it burn" policy recommended a temporary halt to the
policy. The recommendation came after the worst fire season ever in
Yellowstone National Park.

The review team was asked to look at policies throughout the national
parks and wilderness areas, not just Yellowstone.

The report said no fires should be allowed to burn until government
fire management plans are improved and strengthened.

Experts say fire renews forests, giving new species a chance to grow,
encouraging wildlife and recycling nutrients.  But they also said, "in
some cases, the social and economic effects" of allowing a forest fire
to burn "may be unacceptable."</SUM>
