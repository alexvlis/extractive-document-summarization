In 1988 and 1989 forest fires burned out of control throughout the
United States.

One of the largest fires charred more than 2.1 million acres in
Alaska. Another three blazes burned more than 208,000 acres in
Montana.

Following the 1988-forest fire season, a panel studying the
government's "let it burn" policy recommended a temporary halt to the
policy.

Experts say fire renews forests, giving new species a chance to grow,
encouraging wildlife and recycling nutrients.  But is also said, "in
some cases, the social and economic effects" of allowing a forest fire
to burn "may be unacceptable."</SUM>
