In 1988 and 1989 forest fires burned out of control throughout the
United States.

One of the largest fires charred more than 2.1 million acres in
Alaska.  Meanwhile in Wyoming, eight fires burned over 231,000 acres
covering one-fifth of Yellowstone National Park. Another blaze covered
a 109,000-acre section of the North Fork area of the park.

At one point in 1988, three blazes burned more than 208,000 acres in
Montana after another 173,000 acres had burned earlier in the year.
Others states hit hard by forest fires included California, Utah,
Nebraska, Oregon, Washington, Michigan, Kentucky, Idaho, Arizona,
Georgia and New Mexico.

In the case of a fire in New Mexico, a creek polluted with ash, forced
biologists to rescue hundreds of endangered fish.  Officials said 566
Gila trout were fished out of Diamond Creek in and brought by truck to
the Mescalero Fish Hatchery.

Others forest fires crossed into residential areas and forced the
evacuation of some homes.

Many of the fires were started as a result of lightening. Fireworks
set off in celebration of Independence Day caused others. Humans
started other fires; some were reportedly deliberately set.

Dale Smallwood, a criminal investigator for Missouri's Mark Twain
National Forest looks for clues after fires.  He said a split charred
tree stump would indicate that lightening started the fire.  Carbon
particles indicate the exhaust of a passing truck was the culprit.
After accidental causes are ruled out, Smallwood comes down to arson
in most of his investigations.

Following the 1988-forest fire season, a panel studying the
government's "let it burn" policy recommended a temporary halt to the
policy. The recommendation came after the worst fire season ever in
Yellowstone National Park.

The review team was asked to look at policies throughout the national
parks and wilderness areas, not just Yellowstone.  However, it did not
consider policies in other areas such as ordinary national forests.

The report said no fires should be allowed to burn until government
fire management plans are improved and strengthened.

It said actual fire management plans often have not been spelled out
when natural fires would be allowed to burn and when they would be put
out.

Experts say fire renews forests, giving new species a chance to grow,
encouraging wildlife and recycling nutrients.  But is also said, "in
some cases, the social and economic effects" of allowing a forest fire
to burn "may be unacceptable."</SUM>
