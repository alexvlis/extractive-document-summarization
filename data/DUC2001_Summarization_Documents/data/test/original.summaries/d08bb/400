Solar eclipses, one of nature's most awesome spectacles, occur because
the sun, although 400 times wider than the moon, is also,
coincidentally, 400 times farther away from the earth.  Twice a year,
when they line up with the earth, the shadow from the moon blocks the
sun's light on a portion of the earth.  An eclipse will occur at any
one spot on the earth only once every 360 years.  Fewer than a third
of all solar eclipses are total.  The oldest record of a solar
eclipse, written on a Syrian clay tablet, happened on March 5, 1223
B.C.

Throughout history, the average person witnessed these spectacles with
varying degrees of wonder, awe and fear.  Today, although most
educated people consider a total eclipse to be a festive,
theme-park-like occurrence, many still cling to talismans and old
rituals to ward off possible ill effects of the event.  Actually, very
serious, permanent eye damage can result from looking directly at a
solar eclipse.  Viewers are warned to watch these events only through
protective devices such as special Mylar glasses, welder's masks or a
"pinhole camera" which is made by punching a pinhole in a piece of
paper and looking downward at the pinhole shadow.

On July 11, 1991, one of the longest, almost seven minutes, and most
spectacular eclipses of this century cut a swath 165 miles wide from
Hawaii, through the southern Baja Peninsula and into central Brazil.
Tens of thousands of spectators and scientists gathered at the two
locations deemed best for viewing, Mexico's Baja peninsula and the
"Big Island" of Hawaii.  Officials in both places, although welcoming
the economic boost of tourism, were concerned that the infrastructure,
e.g., accommodations and transportation, was not adequate to handle
the expected onslaught.  Hotel rooms had been fully booked, many a
year in advance.  Airlines were at maximum capacity.  Hawaii received
30,000 visitors more than the 18,000 normally expected for this time
of year.  Police in the Baja turned back travelers from the
U.S. unless they had written proof of confirmed accommodations on the
peninsula.  Viewing conditions for this eclipse were not optimal.
Three of ten scientific experiments at the astronomy observatory atop
13,800-foot Mauna Kea were thwarted due to a cloud layer hiding the
eclipse.  It was through eclipse studies that scientists discovered
helium and also proved the validity of Einstein's theory that the mass
of a star can bend light.</SUM>
