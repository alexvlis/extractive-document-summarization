The unofficial tornado season runs from April through June in Texas
and other Tornado Alley" states.  Most track southwest to northeast.
The typical tornado is about 50 yards wide and travels about two miles
on the ground.  Less than two percent of tornadoes are classified as
violent.  Tornadoes travel at an average speed of 30 miles and hour,
but can stand still or go 70 mph.  The average number of
tornado-related deaths per year, 99, has been declining.

Tetsuya Theodore Fujita, one of the world's leading authorities on
tornadoes, discovered that most strong tornadoes are actually six or
seven small twisters called suction vortices rotating around the
center of a larger tornado.  The "Fujita Scale" measures the strength
of tornadoes.  One of the strongest in recent years occurred in
Huntsville, Alabama in November 1989, killing 17 people, injuring 463
and leaving 1,000 homeless.

A tornado watch means that conditions are suitable for a tornado to
develop.  A tornado warning means that one has already been spotted.
If caught in a tornado at home, go to the basement.  If in a car, take
cover in the nearest ditch or depression.  Flying debris causes most
fatalities, so lie down and cover your head.</SUM>
