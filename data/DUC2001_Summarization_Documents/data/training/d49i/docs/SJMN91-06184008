<LEADPARA>  Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan is expected to be reappointed to
another four-year term any time now.;    But analysts say the timetable for a
reappointment is getting especially tight, considering that the Fed chairman's
term ends Aug. 11, less than a month-and-a-half from now.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "What are they waiting for? Does it mean that something's up?" asks William
Dudley, senior economist at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.;    Delaying reappointment,
say some analysts, is the Bush administration's way of keeping Greenspan on
tenterhooks and making sure the central bank doesn't assert its independence
too strongly.;    Dudley says the fact that Greenspan hasn't been reappointed
with six weeks left in his term "does raise legitimate questions" about the
Bush administration's intentions.;    Bush and his advisers have often
criticized Greenspan's Fed and have implied that the central bank waited too
long to cut interest rates at the start of the recession last summer. And, in
recent weeks, there have been vague rumors in the financial markets that the
administration may seek to replace Greenspan.;    One name that has popped up
as a prospective candidate is Martin Feldstein, the former chairman of
President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers. He is rumored to be
interested in the Fed chairmanship and supposedly has some backing from within
the Bush administration.;    Feldstein didn't return several telephone calls
to his office in Cambridge, Mass., where he is president of the National
Bureau of Economic Research.;    However, David Jones, economist at Aubrey G.
Lanston &amp; Co., says the idea of Feldstein as Fed chairman is "a little
far-fetched.";    "There's nobody in the wings, in the way that Greenspan was
in the wings" when former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker was being considered for
reappointment, says Jones.;    Volcker was reappointed June 18, 1983, after
considerable public debate. Then-President Reagan's Treasury secretary, Donald
Regan, opposed Volcker's reappointment, but Volcker's popularity in the
financial community pushed Reagan into giving him four more years.;   
Greenspan also holds the confidence of the financial community.;    "It's hard
to fault his performance, in terms of his pushing for an ease, while
maintaining the credibility of the Fed," says Goldman's Dudley.;    Even so,
the June 18 date Volcker was reappointed was viewed late and that date has
long since passed for Greenspan. Some analysts note, too, that Joint Chiefs of
Staff Chairman Gen. Colin Powell, whose term wasn't up until October, has
already been reappointed.;    "There are reasons to ask questions" about
whether a Fed chairman should be retained, says Carol Stone, senior economist
at Nomura Securities International Inc. "After all, we've had a recession.";  
 Indeed, the U.S. economy has been locked in a recession since July 1990.;   
But few economists lay the recession at the Fed's doorstep and, Stone says,
"The level of satisfaction (with Greenspan) is certainly sufficient to keep
him on.";    Jones of Lanston, a firm noted for its Fed connections, says his
"sources inside the Fed say nobody feels anything other than that Greenspan
will be reappointed.";    If reappointed, Greenspan would have to go through
another round of confirmation hearings before the Senate Banking Committee.;  
 But a Fed spokesman in Washington says those hearings could be scheduled for
a date after the Aug. 11 end of the chairman's first term, provided the
president said he wanted Greenspan to carry on.;    Technically, that means
Greenspan could be kept in limbo until after his mid-July Humphrey-Hawkins
testimony, where he will give the central bank's economic outlook for the rest
of the year. No date has been set as yet for the semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins
hearing.;    A reappointment delay would sustain the administration's pressure
on the Fed chairman not to say or do anything particularly depressing in
regard to economic growth.;    "By delaying the reappointment, the
administration is able to put considerable political heat on Greenspan," says
Jones. "They can lean on him a little more strongly.";    Certainly, there's
been heat on the Fed in the last few months from the administration and from
private analysts.  </TEXT>
